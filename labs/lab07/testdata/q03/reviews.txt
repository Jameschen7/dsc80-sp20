works great  i called t mobile and had this sim card activated in 5 minutes  they have a automated system or you can speak to a rep 
these items looked to be of good quality and have lasted several months so far  i am satisfied with the purchase  considering the low cost 
this product arrive faster than i expected  i love how it looks and feel  the price is pretty cheap  will def  order it again but in different colors 
i brought this for my sister who has a g2 but not sure how it works yet  will let you know as soon as you update me updateit was too small  for  her  phone   per  the  description  should  fit her t  mobile galaxy but it  didn't  i  didn't  bother to  mail it back 
 i am both delighted and disappointed with dell venue pro  windows phone is the operating system of my choice primarily due to its productivity  venue pro is very much businesslike  precisely the type of mobile phone i want  however  the terrible power management makes it virtually unbearable to me let me give my ratings below first  on a scale of 10  with numbers in the parenthesis for iphone 4 as a reference  thermal performance   2  8 battery life   2  7 build quality  9  9 5 screen quality  9 5  9 5   processor   meaningless comparison  but see  speed and efficiency  os reliability   9 9  9 5 os fluency   9 5  9 0 os feature depth   6  9 os flexibility customization   5  8 os app ecosystem   5  9 5 productivity   9  5 form factor and appearance   completely subjectiveentertainment  9  9 speed and efficiency  9  7   yes the retina screen of iphone 4 has higher resolution  but the screen of venue pro looks slightly better under sunlight  in practice it's a wash as you can see above  venue pro even manages to beat iphone 4 in the few very important areas  but at the end of the day  it's just such a miserable device   the venue pro is otherwise a very capable phone  but the power management which includes thermal performance and battery life is so terrible  it really deserves a failing grade   a pity  because this phone with windows 7 5 would have been a quite attractive device the power management deserving of flunking gradefirst  it runs very warm in your hands  quite uncomfortable after just a few minutes of running a few apps  some email checking or web browsing  this is not only uncomfortable  but could actually be even a health concern  i know what heat and radiation of a mobile device can do to human body  my hands got a slowly burnt condition as a result of  longtime use of windows tablet computers  with venue pro  the thermal problem is so seriously bad that the issue alone makes it an extremely undesirable phone second  the battery life is miserable  not really surprising given the bad heat problem  this phone will not last a day  unless you don't use it at all   it can support only about 2 hours of continuous use  many times whorse than my laptop  it has just a bit over 24 hours of standby time even if you don't use it at all  again  many times worse than my laptop    any modestly use  for example  very modest amount of browsing and e mailing plus a few short calls  will exhaust the battery of this phone before the end of the day  i am not a heavy mobile user  and still i usually end up having to charge it at least once a day  when i'm out on a trip  twice or more a day  making it among the biggest mental burdens while you're traveling  simply not worth it  this is absolutely the worst battery performance among the many phones i have used or and handled   to me   this is simply unacceptable  it may be too much to ask for a phone that last for a week  especially with the smart phones becoming almost full featured computers  but failing to last even a single day is too much of a shortcoming mixed bag with the wp 7 5 osi love and hate windows phone os  the user interface is very intuitive  glitch free and just so smooth  which is every bit as good as ios  but much better than android    the best of all  however  is that windows phone os is the most productive smart phone os among the major platforms  if you are a content consumer  all three mobile platforms are shoulder to shoulder  but if you are a content creator  windows phone is far ahead  the iphone and android cannot match the power of microsoft's office 365 which integrates with microsoft phone perfectly   if you or your company subscribe to office 365 and use the cloud versions of the outlook  teamsite and sharepoint  the microsoft phone can do almost anything you can do using a laptop  although with certain limitations on the small user interface  even if you don't use office 365  getting the free windows live and skydive  which is very much underrated  would already be an excellent productive user experience another potentially killer app on wp is the just released skype  still beta  but very usable   if you use skype pro or skype out  you can actually make phone calls anywhere in the world as long as you have wi fi connection  no cellular connection is required  i was on an international trip the other day  and it came extremely handy  i was able to make calls back to home and work at the airports even though i did not have a sim card for the local service  even after i got a temporary local sim card  i continued to use skype on my windows phone to make calls using the 3g data service on the card  because it costs only two cents a minute  less than 1 20 of the cost for international calls made on that type of sim card   this is potentially a huge differentiator for windows phones  i hope microsoft can make the point clear for users   because they own skype  they could make it exclusive  if doing that helps to make windows phone a success  i am all for it  because i'd hate to see windows phone fail  i need something different from iphone or android for my lifestyle but the wp7 5 os is not fully cooked yet even with the latest mango update  the depth of customization is just not there just to name a few  1  you can't turn off that stupid screen auto rotation  you simply can't so far  no user settings has that  no app that does that  even unlocked phone can't do that  forgive me to call auto rotation feature stupid  but it is one of those tech things that made no sense on a mobile phone  precisely because a mobile phone is just so  mobile  the problem is that these device designers fail to understand that the proper  or desired  orientation of the screen simply cannot be determined by an orientation sensor  it is not a mechanical problem  it is a human problem  even if they were so sure that they could decide what the user desires based on a sensor reading  they still fail to understand that it is the relative positions of both the phone and the user's body posture that are more relevant  not the position of the phone itself  a mobile phone can be in many different positions in relation to the user's body position  and a single sensor is not capable to determine such relative positions  the current sensor can only detect the phone's orientation itself  not its relative position to the user's body posture   in practice  the autorotation causes much more annoyance than any utility  it is ok if they just want to use it as a gimmick to attract shallow feature counters  but it is not ok to have it permanently implemented and cannot be turned off  it's simply stupid actually  the reason why i make this auto rotation issue such a big deal is just to make a point  not because the thing itself is so life threatening  i can live with the annoyance  but the failure or overlook of such issues is very telling of the level of ergonomics the maker of this phone understands or is willing to make an effort to  2  you can't edit the individual fields of in a contact profile  and the given choices such as  mobile    home    home 2  are simply too rigid to satisfy even quite ordinary needs  3  copy and paste is still an issue  although works quite well within the same application  it does not work very reliably  across applications  it works across some applications but not others those are just several among many small details  microsoft has done the hard part of building a very promising mobile os  why is it so difficult for them to do these very basic and simple things right  it is obviously not an engineering issue   it is a product management issue  it is a company culture issue  microsoft's level of paying attention to details can't match that of ios  while its level of geekness can't match of that of android  so at the end it loses on both sides  perhaps wp really is meant for low level entry users  but with dell venue pro  we are talking about a business mobile phone here mixed bag with the hardwarethe hardware of dell venue pro is a mixed bag as well  in addition to the power management issue which is downright terrible  this phone is a little bit too bulky  particularly too thick  the thickness is partly a result of including a hard button keyboard  which i thought would be almost a necessity for someone like me  but turned out to be almost superfluous  ironically because the soft keyboard is extremely good and even has some significant advantages over the hard keyboard due to its programed flexibility and extensions   i personally think the soft keyboard of venue pro is even better than that of iphone 4  which itself is excellent  there are other details which dell failed to pay attention to  for example  the hard keyboard keys are illuminated  which is good  but the illumination does not turn on at the desired time  it does sometimes  but usually off when you actually needed  have no idea what they were thinking  clearly  neither microsoft nor dell is apple when it comes to paying attention to user experience details otherwise  the hardware is fine  the screen is beautiful  the iphone 4's retina screen may sound better in the specification  but in practice you really don't see any difference  both are extremely good  and the dell screen is actually better under the sunlight  the build quality is very high  although it uses a chipset and processor from three years ago  the phone is not slow in any measure  there simply isn't a problem in this aspect of all  i haven't compared it with iphone 4s  but the venue pro is actually faster than iphone 4  even though the latter uses a more powerful processor  this is a testament to the efficiency of microsoft phone os in summary  i don't recommend this phone  if one is interested in mobile productivity  microsoft phone is the platform to go  but this is not it  one should wait until microsoft phone 8 0  apollo  is put on a top of line nokia lumia 
of all the protectors i had seen for the nexus 4  this was the only nice looking one i could find that had a protector for the back of the phone  which is glass   this cover snaps on securely  yet is still easy to remove if pried the correct way   i have fumbled the phone a couple of times and the bumper has kept it completely safe   while i hate covering up the back   34 prism  34  glass on this phone  i would rather it be kept safe   with this and a halo screen protector  i have the phone fairly well covered in protection drawback   only one   due to the way the plastic protrudes over the buttons  sticking out somewhat from the bumper  they are often pressed accidentally   a minor complaint  but it is a little too easy to press them   for the protection given  i'll live with the trade off 
this screen protector is great for protection  ex  dropping it on gravel   the only cons i don't care for is the sticky feeling of the screen due to it being a soft screen protector  i also don't like the fact that the screen protector seems to have ripples all over it which is unnoticeable while the screen is on 
i bought this for my boyfriends birthday present after seeing his best friend with one  and this little jambox has been the answer to all of our portable music problems  it's tiny but man does it pack a punch  it has a good bass to it too  and that is impressive  it takes a few times to get the hang of how it works especially if you have two people connected to it but we got it down  the battery even lasts about 4 6 hours on constant play which again is impressive  we love love love this thing 
this iphone case is truly awesome  besides actually protecting the back and the screen of the phone  it has a metal kick stand attached to the back that i have not yet figured out how to use properly 
my wife uses her phone quit a bit all day and night  she gets almost two days from this battery  would buy again if needed 
very nice little item   stands out in your purse   it really is a generic clamshell with a little net  luggage holder  like the net on the back of a car trunk to hold your item in place  i use it for ear bud earphones   makes a cute little gift too   the cable tie is worthless  but no matter  not really needed with the little round case 
gets the job done  i dont use it everyday  its more of an assessory to camofauge my mobile phone  durible enough to withstand multiple dropps or falls  will purchase this brand again if needed
i bought this cover after using the samsung flip cover  i have an i stand  inc  sport model cell phone holder for the car and couldn't see my screen  now with this cover  my phone is protected and i can view the screen  it's also not bulky like an otter box  so i love it 
really awesome product  not bulky like some other screen protectors  doesn't affect typing or the viewing of things on the screen
i have tried the various 3m screen protectors and this one is great  hides your screen from others so you can view your data securely  i am not enamored with the cardboard applicator but it seems to do the trick  if you want the feel of glass  this is not the protector for you  however  if you want privacy  this is it 
i received my case today  i am skeptical of its performance  i have otter box cases for my other electronics so when i ordered this case i was expecting the same quality material as the otter box but less weight  for the price i was expecting something more durable  once i put the case on as instructed i tried to make a phone call and i realized that the sound was low too none  i had to mess around with the case and the buttons on the phone to get it to adjust so i can hear it  then i tried to plug in my head phones and i realized i can not use them without the headphone adapter  i am kind of scared to even put the case with my phone in water  even though it passed the water test without the phone  i am still scared  otter box spoiled me  i am expecting this lifeproof case to give me the same performance of a tank  like the otter box  i thought i would give this case a try to see if it stands up to its claims 
the price can not be beat on this product  for anyone with a tablet these work perfectly and best part is because of the price you are never worried about losing one 
i had this smartphone for about 2 months  and it is a great android os  it is the latest os so far at 2 2  and as matter of fact  some smartphones in the verizon and att networks are still running 2 1  so you'd be running a top of the line os battery life is great lasting all day long if you install one of the battery management apps such as  battery saver  and set it to turn off unused apps every 1 or 2 minutes  in my opinion this is the best app for the task  just make sure you set the right apps to be stopped  nothing worthwhile is easy the screen is bright and websites look beautiful  the only problem i have with this smartphone as well with any other touchscreen  including  er  iphone  is that the touchscreen keyboard sucks  it doesn't matter what people say  it is not easy to use a touchscreen keyboard  and it takes a big chunk of the screen  so  i'm letting this smartphone go  and i will get the samsung intercept which has a slide out keyboard  the way nature intended with real keys even though it doesn't have a dedicated graphics processor  i don't care  since i don't play video games much one thing i forgot is that the optimus v plays videogames fluidly  including angry birds and racing games  but playing video games on a touchscreen is not the way nature intended  buy a psp for that  later  
good sound a very good price looks good to and is comfortable in the ear so what more can i say 
work well with seniors who do not have good tactile fingers or large fingers on a ipad mini   price is great 
i bought red  blue and black  the black is my favorite  they do help protect the phone  and for the price these are really good cases  all the ports and holes are were they should be  i also like that they are tpu and not silicon because silicon starts to stretch after awhile  i also like having cases with stands because i like to watch a lot of media and these fit the bill  i also bought some more higher end cases like incipio  uag  and seidio active  etc 
this is the same charger that came with the razr v3 phone   light  compact  charges the phone 
i purchased this in hope the reviews that said it glowed were correct  unfortunately they were not  i tried editing my settings but nothing worked 
this is a great item for the price i paid for it  highly recommend it but if it gets just a lil wet u can wrap it up because it's over with
tips appear on stylus too large for galaxys3 disappointed  items also appear to be much more costly then they were last 
i have tried several  and failed  other bt head phones  both more and less expensive  and until now it's been bad   these sound great and have an incredible range  i use an iphone    they are very comfortable and come with additional ear pieces to fit any ears   the block outside noise wonderfully   they also work well when talking on the phone  people i have talked to say they sound normal  i haven't used them outside  so i don't know how well the cancel wind noise and such  
came with charger  extra battery  and i holster that you can charge a battery in was able to charge two batteries at once due to having two shargers and this geeat for a phone with little battery life 
i've tried this with many galsxy s3 phones and nothing it won't even charge my phone when i have the chargerin it      and the day i opened it there was something shaking inside the little white square  very bad buy and very disappointed
overall i like this case   it offers decent coverage and protection for such a slim profile   on the same note  i don't think it would hold up well to drops from waist height or higher   but for everyday bumps and scratches  it suffices   i did notice it is a bit slippery   the buttons are nice and tactile  albeit the power button is a touch sensitive  especially when removing from the pocket  i always seem to hit it when taking the phone out   i use this case when i'm not using my primary uag case   i have several different usb charging data cables and haven't run into any fitment problems   every set of corded earbuds i have fit the port for the headphone jack 
i bought this case for a brother ds 600 mobile scanner as it was advertised to fit that scanner   however  upon receipt i could not fit the scanner into the case as it is about 1 2 inch too short   it is a good quality case  well made and sturdy but they advertise that it will scanners that it clearly can not 
i purchased this product to protect my fianc eacute 's phone and it has been worth every penny  he absolutely loves the protector 
my daughter loved this case   it blends in well with her zebra room   she has a galaxy s iii and loves all the colors 
so i bought this considering it had decent reviews  the quality is very poor  the glass separates from the screen and i have to push it down to  reseat  it  low quality adhesive  who knows  also it does not come with the mesh that goes behind the ear piece speaker  so if you look at the front of your phone it looks not oem  also my screen is darker in the center  i noticed this when using the camera and on certain apps  so the outside of the screen is light while about the size of a quarter in the center is darker  very annoying  i hope the seller see's this and tries to make it right be warnedbuy another screen  this one is cheap quality and not worth your money 
extremely fragile   cheap materials do not buy   i cannot put it back together   i am glad i did not mess up my iphone
i really like this pen   i have more expensive styli  but this in my go to option   well worth the money 
the zebra wood case for my samsung galaxy 4 is absolutely gorgeous   it is very rich looking  and i have had many compliments on it from people of both genders   i am so happy with my purchase 
this is a great generic charger from amazon basics   similar products go for twice as much   buy this one if you want to save some hard earned coin 
i love this case  i bought it in different colors  protect my phone well  great gift to give to friends 
my kids go through cables like they are candy so i always go for cheap   they go through cheap ones just as fast as expensive ones   for some reason cables don't work well when they are slept with or worn in pockets or kept in backpacks and purses  anyway  they lasted a week or two with my kids  but the ones i claimed are still going strong  take care of them and they work fine  the image shows a   34 gift  34     we didn't get a gift  but we did get the cables and they are pretty and work well enough 
i bought this case for my friend and he absolutely loved it it gave his iphone a new lookgreat product 
good quality  perfect case  you can put 3 cards and has a space for bills  i hope that last a while
amazed at how easy it was to apply the screen protector  great product  very pleased and will purchase this brand for all of my cell phones 
not worth buying  can't read screen when sun is out  good only when inside and at night  will not recommend
i saw video where car runs over this case and the phone is still good   i dropped my phone from my lap to the tiled floor and cracks my screen   also  the rubber part of the case goes soft and squishy after one year of use  it doesn't align with the home button anymore worst  otterbox wouldn't be responsible for fixing your phone if it couldn't protect your phone due to natural damage 3x the price as other case  i would expect more  3x more 
this fits my s3 mini like a glove   would recommend to my friends   great price too and i bought it when i couldn't get one from the manufacturer website of my cell 
so far i will give it 5 stars   it charges as fast at my wall outlet and seems to be durable   i have already suggested this to two other friends who have purchased it 
it's fashionable and sleek  love it on the black iphone  not sure how it would hold up in a drop   no complaints 
i have owned the iphone 3gs and now the iphone 4  between the 2 i have purchased 3 different cases for the iphone 3gs and this is my second case for the iphone 4  i also have the apple bumper   the cost of the various cases i have bought have ranged from  20  50  here is my basic impression of how the sonix case stacks up 1  build quality  this is a very thin and lightweight case  if you want a case that will protect your phone from drops  the apple bumper may be a better choice  in fact i did drop the phone with the bumper and there were no scratches  zero  haven't had an accident with this one  but it's a nice quality case  with a very nice grip but it's main function is to protect the phone from nicks and bruises in daily use  i have switched to using this as my default case 2  design  this is the best 'looking' case i have ever owned  it is very slim and light and compliments the iphone 4 beautifully  whereas with the apple bumper you completely lose the metal looks of this band  this one keeps enough highlights of the aluminium band that the phone does not lose any of its attractiveness  with any other phone i would not care about cloaking the phone in a case  but the iphone 4 is a thing of beauty  you just need to see it and hold it to know what i mean  this case is unique because it does not change either the balance or the looks of the phone  it compliments it very well 3  impact on antenna issue  frankly i have had no dropped calls with my iphone 4  it is better than my iphone 3gs in very way in terms of call quality  in fact i was in the outer banks recently and  while my wife sony ericsson c902 phone had a hard time keeping a signal for a call  the iphone 4 had no issues  i do have the issue where the bars will drop when you hold the phone a certain way  but it has no impact on my call quality  this case  like the bumper helps in not dropping the bars compared to holding the phone  but it does not help or degrade the call quality  so  if you are looking to get this case to help with call quality i am afraid my experience in both the washington dc area and the outer banks and places in between says it won't help or hurt   4  value  at  19 99 this is a no brainer really  you get the best looking case that is very functional and elegant  i don't really use the screen protector  the screen on the iphone 4 is already pretty glare resistant    more so than the 3gs  so the screen protector can help with scratches but not for glare  for what it's worth i used my iphone 4 as a gps for our trip to the outer banks  the screen on the iphone 4 was completely readable even in the brightest and direct sun light  the screen on the iphone 4 is fantastic and covering it up with a protector doesn't seem like a good idea  to me at least  overall  i am really happy with this case and would recommend it to anyone 
i thought this was going to be a great thing for me and the girlfriend but they would not stay on and they would just come on and shut off when ever they wanted   look somewhere els for this 
this screen protector is one of the best i have used   it is a very exact fit  so it is important to get it lined up accurately   i installed my first one on my iphone 4s  then received my slide on case  which was a little tight and caused the screen protector to curl    not the screen protectors fault  i used a second protector and made sure to line it up exactly   using the credit card to smooth as you go works wonders   my slide on case went on without a problem  and my screen is clear and bubble free   i have no rainbow effect or other issues   just a note    i did not remove the original plastic screen cover that came with the phone until i had these in my possession    so my screen has never seen dust or fingerprints 
this was a total waste  it will not fit my jeep dash at all and even my girlfriends hhr the bottom screw hits the volume button waste of cash
cable does the job and i only bought it as a cheap alternative to the overly pricey manufacturer brand name cables   occasionally does not work properly when charging the iphone  just unplug and replug return to working order 
i firmly admit that i am anti selfies  they're a necessary evil  unfortunately that are abused by too many  i do have to reconcile this with the fact that i like using my iphone to take photos  enter the iluv selfy case  the case itself is pretty solid and feels like it could take a few drops without damaging the phone  sizewise  it's not too big and i don't mind it in my pocket the camera shutter is genius  it's done over bluetooth and works just fine  this way  you can use the rear iphone camera  the one with the better lens  and properly set up your shot and run into frame  as opposed to using the front camera with less resolution   it's definitely helped out when i've set up the camera on longer exposures  shaky hands   shaky photos  overall this is a pretty decent case  if you find yourself taking lots of photos  this might be a no brainer  the price is decent for a multi function case and the fact that it integrates well into their car bike mounts is an added plus 
fits great  easy to install  all of the ports line up nicely   i did not experience any strong odor that other reviewers have mentioned  the only minor con is there is no access to the microsd card  but if you upgraded to a larger capacity card you shouldn't need to take it out too often and the case is easy enough to remove 
i purchased this so that i wouldn't have to search for my ringing phone or keep looking down while trying to see my telenav directions on my phone   my windshield is too deep and my sight too bad to allow me to stick the device to it so i took a few weeks before committing to mounting this permanently to my dashboard   when i did a whole new world opened up to me   i put my phone in it and my ipod and enjoy the accessibility i now have   it's a great product 
perfect snug fit on my iphone 4  would've given it a 5 star but the lens for cam and flash were not aligned  but other than that it looks nice on phone 
i was so happy to receive my beloved motorola h730 bluetooth headset about 3 wks ago  only to be disappointed and have my bubble burst   i read the reviews good and bad  weighed that odds and decided to ignore the complaints about the headset dying within 2 wks of purchase   i threw away the packaging and guess what   my bluetooth stopped working   ugh     now  i'm stuck with a  52 dud   thanks for nothing 
i love that i can be hands free  including the connection as long as the device is powered on   just be careful  i left it on one evening  my phone rang  and apparently i was close enough to the car for it to connect     turning it off each night will solve that problem 
the case is serviceable  but feels a bit loose  the same is true of other silicone rubber cases i've received from different sellers  i like it's old school feel  was inexpensive enough that i'll use it from time to time just for the fun of it  which fits why i bought it 
i am grateful to be able to try this out for such an affordable price  but i have to give one star because i could not get it to work at all  using samsung galaxy nexus and samsung smart tv  i bought the unit because i travel a lot and i wanted to use something for my hotel stays  i wish the device had come with some kind of instructions or support  i have tried everything posted on these reviews to no avail  good luck  it would be an awesome price if it works for you 
nokia arrive really soon   the item was old and had been returned by someone   it's my fault i should have check the photos for a couple of times before buying   not totally crazy with nokia lumia 900 afterall i've seen it   i did returned it and it was easy an smooth seller and amazon respond as soon as i wrote them about it
just like they advertise you can use this blue tooth to make calls and music comes through smoothy and has a wonderful sound 
thank you for the qucik service after droppingmy ipad 2 i thought it was gone a few parts from amazon and all better not the easiest thing i have ever done  but more fun that a puzzel sevcie was great and shipent was ontime many tnaks 
i really like the features and the call quality of this headset  when i've asked people i'm talking to they cannot tell that i'm using a headset  and my end is always nice and clear  i like that it tells you how much charge is left in the battery when you turn it on  and that it uses the same micro usb connector as my phone does  so i can pretty much charge it anywhere  battery life is really good too  i've had it for about a month and have only had to charge it once    granted  i don't live on my phone and really only use it when i'm in the car  but that's still good battery life  it also reads text messages and streams music from my phone  that's pretty neat too on the down side  the rubber ear piece that is included  and there's only one  hurt my ears  luckily it takes a standard size earpiece and i was able to get an assortment of different sizes for 99 cents from a different vendor  now i don't even need the ear hook 
this is a great battery   the sizing is just right for portability  about the size of a small external drive  but has so much juice it seems to go on forever   it takes a while to charge so do it overnight but it is a fantastic battery   got it for  30 on sale at amazon at that price it is 5 stars for sure 
i got this for my htc inspire had this phone for quite some time and it works good and the protector is good 
this is a flimsy rubber car mount for iphone 5  designed to adhere to the center console cons 1   the holder is designed so that  it holds the phone only in landscape mode 2   the phone sits almost vertically  with very little  non adjustable tilt to it so that it can't be really be seen very well  from a console mount position3   the phone slips loosely into rubbery grooves that do not hold it too securely pros 1   it was cheap enough   6 99  not the price listed on this page     to throw away and not feel badly about it one of my worst ever amazon purchases 
overall this does exactly what it intends to do  it charges my iphone 5 and the coiled cord prevents tangles or knots  the only drawback is that the cord is not very long  this may be fine if you are keeping your ios device near the charger  but if you plan on using your ipad or iphone while it's charging you will have to stretch the cord  i could see this being more of an issue for anyone with a dashboard dock for their iphone on a larger car like an suv  i have a vw jetta with a dashboard dock and the cord stays stays plugged into the phone  but the cord does have a fair amount of tension           i received this product for free as part of the amazon com vine program  nonetheless  i review the product in the same manner as i would if i had purchased it myself           
very glad to be able to buy this my grand daughter is 13 but is rough on her phone  trying to avoid breaking the screen 
i hate the fact that i spend a fortune for an iphone and still need a case  but i went without for about a week and  of course  dropped it  one corner of the metal part of the phone popped out of the banana yellow body  and it took me all day to get it to pop back in  this belkin case is mostly translucent  so the nice color still shows through  and it has a nice textured grip  it really does protect the corners and edges  though it does add a little bulk  as all cases seem to do  the buttons are handled with little clear buttons that are part of the case  sitting on top of the phone's actual buttons  and they work really well  there are the usual openings for the switch that silences the phone  the plugs for charging and earbuds  and the camera  the purple stripe looks good with my yellow  and so far my mom hasn't noticed it  so i haven't heard any comments about lsu  if i have to have a case  and i do  it may as well be this one 
this is a hight quality charger it last a fair good amount of time also charges the phone in and hour good product
i was surprised to find a case for the evo 4g at such a great price   i had considered the innocase from seidio  but felt it was high priced   i took a chance on getting this inexpensive case and the gamble payed off   this case was very well thought out  offering additional padding where it's needed during a fall   the back of the case makes a recessed enclosure for the camera and kick stand i purchased the black one as i am not a fan of various colors   the case doesn't add much bulk to the device   the device is already big  so you don't even notice   you'd be happy knowing your device is protected during a fall   nothing worse than your phone hitting the cement unprotected 
this is what you need if you want to charge your ipad in the car  it won't charge with a regular usb port 
love this case  nothing matches up to otter boxes  i wish the back pink real tree print was a bit more like the one for the iphone though  the iphone is more like a print on the actual case while this one feels more like a sticker attached  i'm worried about cleaning it  i'm afraid i might mess up the case  other than that love it 
this is fabulous but be carful because it looks real and unless you know the people you are with it could easily attract the wrong crowd because they are gonna think that you are balling lol
works well but slow to charge  took hrs to charge  but for the price i really cant complain  i use it as a second battery backup so time doesn't concern me 
funny how apple cannot afford to include the tool necessary to open the sim tray     well  if you purchased an iphone and find that you need to open the sim tray  you can either try to bend a paperclip and try to get it in straight  or you can order this tool   personally  i found this tool to work much better i was a bit surprised to find that three tools were included in the shipment instead of the one described   so  i am more than pleased with this order   the tool works great and because of the shape  it goes in straight and opens the tray with ease having three of them makes it less likely to lose the tool   this way i can keep one at home with the paperwork  take one on trips overseas  cheaper to buy prepaid chips at the airports  and have one more put away the tool arrived on time and it works great    i would highly recommend the tool and the vendor 
dropped the phone once and the so called   34 dual layer protection  34  failed   entire front of the screen is shattered even though it fell case side down   kind of disappointing that it didn't offer any type of protection on the fall   i've had other cases that have protected the phone from falls much better 
i really hated having cords all over in my car  got this and it work but the port is a bit loose when connected  as long as i do not bump my phone it will charge and works great  just wish the connection was a bit better 
i love otterbox and i've been using defender cases for 4 years   the 9900 9930 defender is designed wrong   people posting positive reviews most likey have not used the case yet  when you first assemble case on 9930  it feels and looks great   as soon as you try snapping it into the holster  you start wondering why did that takes so much effort   then when try to pull the phone back out of holster  it feels like you're going to break the phone from all the force it takes to get it out then you'll see that the rubber part is coming off and needs to be pushed back on every time the phone comes out   then you'll call otterbox  they will send you the same identical replacement piece that still comes off then you'll need to go spend another  50 on a seidio case   so skip the otterbox step and save some money   i haven't actually bought the seidio case yet because i'm not sure they all have the sleep magnet yet 
this little product doesn't look like it will work  but it does and its pretty cool  it's not as loud as speakers but it definitely amplifies my music 
does  not  work with samsung galaxy 2    sprint's  doesn't fit  have to cut it with scissors and still doesn't really fit 
i got this in a timely fashion and i am very satisfied  it has a good grip an it's a nice fit 
i love thyis case it is very soft material so you won't scratch your phone and fits like a glove along with the belt hook it also has belt loops so you have extra security of the pouch not falling off wonderful 
the new trent arcadia click pen stylus is a very well designed and solid stylus  i prefer the microfiber tip to the rubber ball as seen on other stylus  i always have a fear that the rubber ball will fall off and scratch my screen  i do not have that fear with the microfiber tips in the new trent stylus  the retractable feature is one of the best features i like because it keeps the tip protected when i have the stylus buried in a computer bag  the clip also comes in handy for clipping the stylus to a pocket  the stylus is very responsive on both my htc phone and galaxy tablet  the only improvement that could be made to this stylus is if it was designed with tip similar to a samsung s pen  more of a pencil like tip  
as a screen protector this is okay but not great   i was really excited about the 'mirror' aspect of this cover but i guess i'm in the minority with regards to how mirror like this cover actually is   yes  you can see your reflection but i wouldn't say it's remotely close to an actual mirror like surface   the reflection is more of what you might see looking into a well polished piece of dark glass   the reflected image isn't distorted  which is good   but the reflection lacks brightness and color like you would expect from a mirror  if that makes sense when the back light is lit  the mirrored surface does 'disappear' and is not obtrusive to viewing your ipod display in any way that i found noticeable   as for value  you do receive two of these covers  at least i did  so if you mess up the application the first time you get a second go at it  or  gift it hold on to it use it if you have multiple ipods in the house   application was super easy and i didn't have any problems getting air bubbles out from under the screen i hate to sound so wasteful but the mirrored surface didn't do anything for me and by the end of the day i found that it was really  really difficult for me to rub off any fingerprint marks that had accumulated on my touch   they seem to smear but stay put with the effort you'd normally have to use to remove marks without the cover on   so you need to put quite a bit of effort into it   i ended up removing the cover after only one day's use       i'm glad to hear that this product has met other people's expectations but it didn't meet mine 
no other case will protect your phone such as this one  every other case that i have used as led to a broken screen or damaged part  this is by far the best product to protect your phone  i don't even think its that bulky 
it was not a clear back instead it was all hot pink which i still liked  that's why i gave three stars  did come with screen protector 
if your looking for a portable battery charger go to walmart or something like that  try something with a name brand  or something that's not from china  this product is made cheap  plus when i sent one back  i didn't even get credited for the full amount  they don't charge your cell phone battery  they just kill it  have tried 3  all do same thing  have tried 7 different smart phones  and 3 basic phones  and still decharges battery  on mine  my family  and friends  not happy  
terrible charger  it worked for about a week and then i got the message that says it is not compatible with my phone  total waste of money  i can't see how this would make a difference but it worked just fine when i first got it and was using it in my own car  like i said for about a week   then i went on a trip with some friends and brought it along  where it also worked fine  however  upon plugging it back into my car is when i got the message saying it was no longer compatible with my phone  i don't see how switching cars would have made any difference  probably just a coincidence but either way  it no longer works  even if that was the reason i would expect a phone charger to work in more ports than just one  ridiculous 
i dont think this was an oem replacement   the item stopped working as soon as it was placed into the device 
the fit is ok  a bit cumbersome with glasses the sound quality is very nice the bluetooth fetcher is great but the leia look    so not fitting for public usage
i can charge from nearly dead the following 1 samsung galaxy note 31 samsung galaxy note 10 1  2014 ed 1 nexus 7  2013 ed 1 ps vita  the vita even recognizes it as a charger with the cool graphic 1 nvidia shieldall simultaneously i've now got 3 of them  one at the bedside  one in my living room and one for travel on the road 
i have used this everyday for nearly two months  it has worked flawlessly i would have given 5 stars if the clip was a bit more durable  the volume slider were not so finicky touchy  and the sound didn't distort at loud max volume there are many reviews here already  so i won't elaborate on every detail  but here is my short take pros  excellent sound quality    85  volume   85  distorts a little  long rechargeable battery life  estimate 10 hours  i pair with my windows 8 tabletacer iconia w700 6465 11 6 inch 128 gb tablet  silver and my windows 8 phonenokia lumia 920 4g windows phone  black  at t  at the same time   this allows me to stream hulu netflix songza while still answering phone calls and text messages  with voice dictation    while listening to tablet  the headset switches to phone to announce voice caller id or read text message     i then have ability to use the built in microphone to speak on phone or dictate commands to phone  to dictate text reply      after phone call or text dictation  the headset automatically switches back to play source to resume playback     pair to both by first holding the play button and sliding the volume to choose play source  computer tablet      then pair microphone headset function to phone by holding the phone button and sliding volume to choose headset source displays song info on screen compatible with any headphones  i prefer thejvc hafxc80 black series in ear carbon headphones  very light clip to attach to clothes or bagcons  clip is not durable in rough environments as it has broken off of unit once  luckily i found the v shaped coil spring and was able to put it back together  sound seems to distort a little if you max the touch volume slider while inputting a high volume bt signal volume slider is touch based and is a bit finicky touchy  next iteration sony should use buttons like the rest of the controls i love this product and recommend it highly 
bought this one for my iphone  kind of ok product don't know why i bought this one    i don't use it much 
i have bought two of these cases so far because i love them   one in this color and the other in pink   i really love the cases   this coral blue color is so fun and rare   it reminds me of summer   it is very slim on my phone   i am able to sit my phone in my docking station without removing the case  which is rare for the cases i have found    i have dropped it and the case has held up fine   it does show some minor paint chips on the corners from me dropping it  but nothing actually broke   the cases is extremely hard to get off the phone though   if you like to switch out your phone covers all of the time  this one might not be for you   otherwise   i give it two thumbs up 
i really like d  this item  it fits my wife's galaxy sii  with case  and it worked well for the first few months   as with other reviews mine  i bought 2  have become loose and the phone sags down  bad for driving augmentation apps    i have yet to try the microfiber cloth fix mentioned in other reviews  richard
there isn't to much to review for this it seemed to work just fine there haven't been any issues with the product
easy to install  great protection from otterbox like no other case can provide  i would recommend this to anyone who needs the ultimate protection for cell phone  i was tempted to buy a bulk item but didn't after reading reviews  go with this one 
i ordered this because it keeps the cable safe without twisting  it works great  some cables i have gotten for my fire hd and my fire before that were not good at charging  i attach this to my supercharger plug and it works quickly and efficiently  my girlfriend got a fire hd and i had her order one and an extra one for me to take with me  one at home  one in the case with the kindle  great product  good materials and very good price 
i was looking for a clear case for my new iphone 5s and after reading the positive reviews for this case  i decided to buy it  i was really looking forward to trying this case on my new iphone 5s  i was tracking the delivery from work and when i noticed that it had been delivered i rushed home to try it on my iphone  after taking the case out of the box and removing the plastic wrap from the front and back i noticed a large portion that was scratched  right across the middle of the clear back there were several deep scratches  the scratches are clearly noticeable under light  what a disappointment  how could this have gotten past rearth's quality control  what was the purpose of the plastic wrap on the case if underneath there were already scratches  i understand that clear plastic cases will eventually scratch but being scratched out of the box before even using it is totally unacceptable i contacted rearth's customer service to let them know that the case came defective and that i wasn't satisfied  well  guess what  they haven't responded yet  i contacted them 4 days ago and they have yet to acknowledge my issue  does rearth have a customer service department  i don't know yet  because they haven't answered my call  this is one of the worst customer service departments i know  i have bought several cases from other big brand company's like speck  otterbox  griffin and spigen and they all have customer service departments that actually care about customer satisfaction  how can you run a company that needs sales revenue to be in business and yet you don't care if a customer is unsatisfied with your product  i would have been a satisfied customer if my issue was acknowledged promptly and a replacement case issued  because this might have been an isolated incident i am very unhappy with my purchase of this case and it's been the only negative experience i've had on amazon  i will not be purchasing cases in the future from rearth due to this issue and i wouldn't recommend this case  maybe i got a defective case  but i'll never know because rearth doesn't believe in customer service 
i received this item  free of charge  in return for a considered  unbiased review for every day home and around the office use  this case logic hand grip iphone case works very nicely  it provides just enough protection for an edge or corner during an occasional  typical drop  with no interference of button operation  a nicely textured feel in your hand  and provides adequate friction for remaining in place on level surfaces  although i'm a years long  satisfied user of the otter box  its bulk gets tiresome  especially when the phone spends almost all its time in non industrial settings  assess the chances of a maximum height drop onto a tile floor occurring  and the amount of exposure to a dirty  oily or dusty environment that is in your phone's future to judge which product is right for most urban dwellers  matching this product with your favorite variety of screen protector makes you good to go  for a great price lastly  a lengthy comment and focus on the potentially impractical white   light gray color  yes  it will accumulate skin oils and get dirty  but a periodic  quick soak in a light solvent  simple green is my go to  and two minutes of brushing action will suffice to keep it bright  the two piece  harder plastic frame   silicone rubber insert  design makes that an easy process  with the insert retaining its shape nicely even after multiple ingress egress cycles  in addition  removing the cover reminds you to brush out the lint   dust micro ibunnies that breed in the tiny corners we now carry with us it also provides a nice method  front face exposed  black  rear cover exposed  white  to denote its presence while at rest on any flat surface  regardless of color or shade 
i like this product a lot  feels like it is a solid  quality item  not cheap  heavy enough to the point where it feels like it was well built  yet still lighter than the iphone   i am satisfied with how fast it charges and how much power it holds  overall 5 
im sure they're cute but i havent seen them at all but they can keep the chump money  its all good
i teach an ipad class for seniors  some who have a difficult time with finger control   these stylus work well for them and make the device much more useable   an unbelievable price  if you lose them it is not a big deal to replace   i have not received any that did not work   bt
while i have an iphone  my mophie case uses a micro usb connection to charge the phone  so this is very handy to have in the car  the unconventional shape of the charger fits in the cigarette lighter port firmly and well  no issues  the thick silicon insulation protects the wires inside from crimping  pinching or tangling  a sharp design   and so brightly colored  you're unlikely to forget to bring it with you  the plug that goes into the cigarette adapter of your car has another usb port so you can plug another usb powered device cable in it   works great for charging my husband's iphone when we travel together  looks to be manufactured to very high standards  i'll be getting other items from this company 
these stylus have been great to use  the tips are soft and they certainly are as good as any on the market that you can pay  10 a piece for  i certainly plan to revisit this vendor again  good quality 
this screen protector is exactly what i was looking for  it hides your screen without dimming it or making it difficult to see  it is also anti glare which is nice  there is a slight grainy appearance to your screen  like you would get with similar anti glare screen protectors  but it's not too bad and i barely notice it anymore after using it for a couple weeks  i'd recommend this to anyone  it's a great product for a great price 
i have ajabra journeyand had to fly out of state to help my daughter move back home  she was to drive the truck and i'd drive the car  i took my jabra and ordered this one for my daughter  so we could communicate safely on our drive back home  i went with this one because of its glowing reviews and cheaper price  i am just so disappointed in it the thing that irritates me more than anything is the charger port location  there is a slide to clip it to your visor  just like the jabra journey  that means that it will face downward  so when you look up at your visor  you'll see the front of the device  fine  that's the way it should be so what engineer in his right mind then would design it so that the charging cord attaches to the back of the device  seriously   i couldn't believe it and don't understand it all  we'll forget for a moment that the slide clip is only magnetized to the device  but having to remove the cord to attach it makes it only good for local use because you have to charge it and then completely remove the cord in order to use it  it's makes it entirely useless for traveling long distances sure you would think that you could just attach the cord anyway and clip it on  it may be lopsided but would still work  right  wrong  because the clip is only magnetized  as soon as you attach the cord down the device falls sound quality is okay  at first my daughter complained about it but that was because she had the window down  she's not familiar with the use of one of these  in any case  when we were in the car  the sound was good  the problem we had was people hearing us  for some reason  they had trouble  my son described it as watery sounding finally  it is not fair to complain that it still stays connected  even when in the house  all of them are designed that way  my jabra does the same thing  this ensures a good connection and should not be a fault  the simple answer is to turn your bluetooth off on your phone  you should do that anyway to save battery life i really have to recommend the jabra  because i absolutely adore it  the cord attaches on its side  as it should  the incoming sound is very loud  so much so that i have to turn it down  everyone can hear me just fine  the only problem with the jabra is its own voice  i can't always understand what she's saying and when she announces the incoming caller's number  i can never hear her  i don't know why its voice is so low  outside of that  it's my only complaint all in all  this isn't such a good deal  i only give it the two stars because it is usable  at least  it just has a serious design defect and output issues 
so far so good  capacity seems to be on par with the stock battery  shipping was extremely fast and the product was well packaged  i've read a lot of the reviews of aftermarket batteries on the tech forums and anker seems to have a good established reputation  i avoided qcell even though it has nfc because it is full of blatantly fake 5 star reviews  it may or may not be a good product but i refuse to give a seller that relies on deception even a single dollar i haven't had the phone long so only time will tell if it will maintain its capacity for any appreciable length of time  it comes with a 1 year warranty so i guess that is time enough to tell  if it maintains its current performance and declines the way the stock battery normally would  then it is well worth the price  it makes no sense to me to purchase  30 batteries that claim a dubious additional 200mah when you can buy 3 generics that are just as good as stock for the same price nfc is not that prevalent right now so it is a non issue for me  maybe once the deal between google and the isis consortium goes through it will be more widespread  however  to me it makes no sense to have to unlock my phone and swipe it  enter a password  and pay rather than to just pay with my credit card  what happens if you run out of batteries  also  it just puts your phone more at risk of being dropped it situations like drive thrus  i think by the time it gets wide spread enough  it will be time for a new battery or phone p s  when looking at reviews  especially for generics that come from taiwan china  look at the reviewers history  often times  they will have just one or two reviews and if they do have more than 1 review  they will all have been made in a short amount of time to give their account a little more legitimacy  the verified purchase means nothing as that is easy to game by the vendor edit well  it is now april 14  2013 and one of the batteries has died  the battery has swollen up a tiny bit in the middle  the big problem is that the phone will become unstable and shut down when indicated power level is 40 50  i drove the battery pretty hard so i'm only going to knock out 1 star as i feel i've gotten my monies worth 
many of us travel today with a bunch of electronic devices that require access to a usb port for charging  this handy little device provides four usb ports  each providing 500ma at 5 volts  that should be enough to charge practically any device such as music players  cell and smartphones  tablets and so on provided you let them charge overnight or at least several hours  500ma isn't enough to fast charge a unit with that caveat in mind  this unit is a good value  it is compact  has ac prongs that fold into the unit and four usb ports with diodes to indicate power on off status on the port  the unit is reasonably well made  the ac prongs were easy to pull out for use  fold up with no problem and have no significant play or looseness  the unit is small  about 2 x 4 5 x 1 inches and weigh little i don't know how long they'll last in operation  but at the price  they're economical enough to replace as needed just remember  this is not suitable for fast charging your devices jerry
i dont know if it was me or the description but this product was no where to what i expected 
my phone is crapping out on me so i ordered a lot of extra batteries and charge two at a time while i'm using one battery  the joy of these chargers is that there's a usb out outlet to charge other usb items  and a mini usb in inlet if you don't have a wall outlet handy 
the clip is not strong enough for a phone as big as the note  it ended up snapping from my belt 
this smart phone is great   does everything i need and more   one of the first and the best smartphones from tracfone   simple to operate   if your ready to upgrade try this   only problem is there is very little memory   ok if you don't download more than 1 2 apps 
we're an apple household  we have 4 ipads  7 ipod's  apple tv  imac's  etc  consequently we're constantly in need of cables to recharge or sync devices  the factory supplied cables are never in the right place at the right time  so having a bunch of extra cables is a necessity  these work great for connecting to our in car infotainment systems  laptops  chargers  etc  they work perfectly  are much cheaper than you can get at wal mart from belkin or any other manufacturer  and i can't tell the difference between these and the ones that came with the apple products 
this case was recommended by reviewers to be used with the seidio innocase holster for the iphone 4  sure enough  it's a great pairing  the ngp material is a little harder than i'm used to  but that's okay and it's kind of growing on me  the fit is perfect  and all controls are easy to use  the cutout at the bottom is big enough for even the bulkiest of dock connectors  my only slight dislike is the bevel around the screen edge  it's nice and high to protect the screen  but it's a bit   34 sharp  34   combine that   34 sharpness  34  with the rigidity of the material  and it makes the phone fairly uncomfortable to press to your ear  especially for long conversations  it would be better if it were more rounded or flat or something  but it's not too bad as it is anyways  if you're looking for a good iphone 4 case holster combo  this is the way to go 
this added some extra battery life compared to the factory battery  i went with this one because i wanted to continue using my rugged case for my phone  most extended batteries require a different back plate  this one will work with your original back plate but it is a tighter fit  after some time by back plate has worn our and doesn't quite completely fasten any more  but since i have the rugged case on it it isn't noticeable and its worth the extra battery life 
you'd think jabra would have bluetooth down by now  this is my second jabra headset and both have below par bluetooth connectivity for example  the motorola sd 10 and the lg tone will work with my iphone as i walk around the house  i can leave my phone downstairs and they will work if i go upstairs  the jabra seems to require line of sight or it cuts out when running  once i break into a sweat they tend to slip off my ear  i'm managing this by pinning them with a headband i do like the little headset battery level indicator on the iphone  i wish other brands had that as i said  they're basically  ok   once this set breaks  i will replace with something else 
high quality great colors i really love this stylus and for the price this is a very good offer i will buy more
i got this charger for my nexus 7 when it was on sale  i never used wireless charging before but decided to give it a try  i have read about people having trouble getting devices  especially tablets  to sit correctly on wireless pads for charging  i have not encountered this problem with this charger and the nexus 7  i enjoy the convenience of just putting my tablet on the pad and easily charging it 
i really like this stylus  it lasts much longer  is much smoother than my old roocase stylus and for the price it can't be beat 
i ordered these headphones for use with my ipad and iphone and it works great  i have listed the pros and cons i found pros   headphones are very comfortable with the padded ears and headband and remain comfortable after hours of use   sound quality is very good although a picky audiophile might grumble   ear pads twist to flat position for easier storage   storage case is great   even has an inside pouch to store accessories   headphones slide up and down for customized fitcons   excessive movement  jumping  dancing  etc   jostles these headphone from their postioni like these headphones for the most part and i recommend them unless you are planning to use them while say dancing and this prevented me from giving it a five star rating 
i decided to finally upgrade my xbox headset from the around the neck one i had been using for some time  after some static and other distortion reported from my friends i figured it would be a good idea  i was going to buy a pair of turtle beach x12's  which i love  and after looking further into the product realized that i needed the optical audio adapter for xbox 360  i found a good price on amazon so i ordered it and had it in a few days love amazon prime  the product was simple to hook up and in no time i had everything i needed to start gaming and using the new headset 
the covers fit beautifully and provide extra protection around the corners of the phone where any impact is likely to do damage  i ordered a couple of extra in case i want to change colors 
love it      great screen protections would give others a thumbs up on this     no problem placing it on my phone
sure beats having to carry the unnecessarily lengthy sync cable that comes with the device   this is a purchase i'll definitely repeat if i happen to misplace this treasure   it is of real good quality   impressive 
yes it protects my s4 good  but it's boring and easily gets covered in lint from a pocket  or wherever  could be better i guess 
it is over the top in quality and durability  it is some kind of military standard  each of the disks on the back is an individually springy shock absorber and corners are reinforced  probably the best phone case i've ever seen  it reminds me of those rugged disk drives the ones you can drop 50 feet  it's a little bit macho almost like it was made for an uzi or something   
this is clearly not a htc cable as it has the blackberry logo on it and the bulk packaging label says blackberry   but it's a oem micro usb cable none the less and works perfectly on any micro usb device i plugged it into while i haven't tested it's speed against other cables i doubt it outperforms any other oem cable but it works and that's all i asked for of it the cable is a bit thick and as a result is stiff but not unmanageably so it should also be noted that the cable shown in the picture is not of the actual product  that is a mini usb cable and appears to be quite a bit longer than the product  this cable is 1m long 
i got the droid mid 2012    a great phone as you already know  with the glaring exception of terrible battery life   well no more   now its even better than a maxx   this supplement battery case is great   i have been running my phone for 3 days now without needing to plug it in   qq tech shipped it early   and it arrived mostly charged   a few details   it works by pressing the power button on the back for a few seconds    and doing that starts transferring power from the case to the phone battery   it has 5 purple dots that give you an idea of how much juice remains in the case   the case is partial coverage  not a  full jacket  cover  so it is semi vulnerable to drops   the nub at the top is where the case plugs into the phone   wish that was not needed  but better that than expand the whole area across the top with the case in place  it also gives much needed relief to the phones power connection plug   i have been concerned given that i have been plugging it in multiple times a day  that the connection would be the first thing to go on the phone i def  recommend this as an alternative to getting rid of your current droid   or possibly as an incentive to get one if you need a used smartphone they are going for 150 250 on ebay   a lot cheaper than a used maxx  4 10 13 update   downgrade to 3 stars   i have yet to 100  figure it out   sometimes i press to charge the phone   and it does so fine  at other times it only partially charges and shuts off    and needs to be restarted to continue charging   in addition  its more finicky  more than my phone  as to which adapters it will accept a charge from   still worth the purchase  esp  given i do not think there are other options   but not perfect   i also broke my razr in feb by dropping it just right so the glass smashed  i now only use this when i know i will need it  otherwise i keep my phone  replaced with a used one from craigslist  in a more insulated case 
i have bulkier cases for when i'm doing something rugged that needs more protection  but this slim silicone case offers great everyday protection  even laying the phone face  screen  down it has raised edges to keep the screen from touching the surface you are laying it on  i can use this with my lap dock  the bulkier cases you have to remove it before using  fits my needs perfectly  the only real issue with silicone cases in general is they are terrible if you are slide in to your pants pocket person  the case will grip the pocket and peel off the phone  it also will collect lint from the pocket as the silicone is   34 sticky  34   not to the touch  but it is to lint 
loved the case and the color  i've had these before and continue to buy them  i would still buy another 
user states that this case is the bomb   perfect fit for his needs   quality and safety get high marks   the kickstand is an added bonus   multiple color options   great deal 
i am a fan of magpul so when i saw their case i immediately had to have it  looks very similar to a pmag and the color is a little darker orange than the stock photo  has withstood daily use and i havent had any damage to my phone  would recommend this to anyone on the fence 
this didn't work well with my samsung note ii  while it did charge  the charger rests on a piece that protrudes from the base of the rest of the charger so it makes the phone extremely unstable when cradled in it  also it didn't fit with my case which was actually pretty slim 
aliph jawbone ii is a farce  i tested it by calling several people and nobody can hear me well  they all said i sounded very far away  even though the volume was at it's maximum  the fit is not comfortable at all  i tried every single earbud and earloop  if the vas button can't make contact with your face  the unit is useless  as you have to press it against your face  face too skinny    what is the point of wearing a headset if you need to use one hand to operate it and the other hand on the steering wheel  this is not safe imho 
i bought two of these and it has given new life to my phone  it is the same as the original battery  its not going to give you more juice than the typical battery for this phone  but it was a good replacement for my old battery that wasn't lasting very long any more 
see review that i wrote on their full body shield   excellent  great product  great protection  great price  wouild recommend this to anyone wanting to protect their screen for a long  long time 
it protects the phone great   it is a little too bulky for me  but i understand why it is   using a screen cover with it is difficult  but not impossible 
i use this product for my iphone 5 and am very pleased with it  the craftsmanship is superb  the texture is sleek and the cover is very durable  make a great gift 
not as glittery as the picture  however it's still cute  the actual sticker is actually a lighter more pastel color of pink  it sticks pretty well  i bought this a while back and still have it on  i get alot of compliments on it as well 
this is the case i am currently using with my 5c  the case is difficult to handle when i want to do something fast but that's a result of a good thing  the magnetic flap does 'stick' well to the case and safely keeps it closed  the color in the pictures is accurate  it indeed looks just like that and the touch of the material is good  the magnetic flap can also be used to close the case behind the phone so you can handle the phone without it moving back to the front and trying to close the case again 
this case was a perfect fit for our note ii  great protection for your device   looks great  clip is sturdy 
the case is of seemingly good sturdy quality  it is a perfect fit for the galaxy s4  i do like how it looks and feels  some have complained that the case should not have buttons  but i completely disagree  i think it having the buttons makes it easier to push the buttons   other than as with some cases having to fit your finger past the case to engage them can become very difficult   especially if it is a thick case the fit is nice and the fact that it can store a couple of cards and money can definitely come in handy  however  i have to address a couple of design issues  one is the amplified sound that should be a big selling point  it was a good try and definitely makes it louder   however louder is not always better  if the sound is turned up at all  it sounds tinnier than normal on the phone  makes sense as the sound is just being bounced from the back speaker and redirected to the front of the case   i could easily give it 4 stars on that as you have no option to use the amplified sound or not   it just is a part of the case  but  since you can always just turn the sound back down to fix the quality a bit  i won't  also  i will add  i did find that you can download certain bass booster apps to help with that issue a bit  the other thing i would like to see is an added kickstand on the design  i am not faulting the makers for not having it mind you  but just suggesting it to improve the design  so basically just create a hole in the back of the case for the sound to escape naturally and add a kickstand and you will have a winner 
works great with yamaha  sendstation  crosley docks and adapters  and with my apple 30 pin cables just one problem  the width of the plug is the same as the apple 30 pin plugs  and the lightning plug is only long enough to go in my ipod touch 5gen with no case on  if there's a back shell or case which only exposes enough for the lightning cable to mate with the port  this plug will not go in all the way  and not work consider if you're deciding on a lightning cable  a microusb to lightning adapter  works well with usb to microusb cables   or a case for your iphone 5 or ipod touch 
love tech armor  i buy all of my screen protectors from them now  looks great and very affordable  you can barely tell there is a screen protector on the phone 
it works and it's cheap   i would think that a firmer  more plastic tip could be engineers  so it lasts longer 
here are my thoughts about this product1  product shipping was fast 2  very easy to apply and surely it doesn't have any bubbles  i only used 2 since my first one i installed it on the rush since i want to set up my phone in my friend's apartment  2nd installation is about  lt 5mins perfect without bubbles  the only problem the you will encounter is the width of the screen protector  you have to align it since it is just right for the size of your screen what i didn't like with this product are  the width of the screen protector only cover the screen so if you use casing that only cover the side of the phone this might not look good especially the top and bottom part  i have hd2 and i use screen protector that covers the entire screen but this one it only covers the end of the speaker in the top and the bottom part of the home button  i hope you can picture out how much space are left uncovered   i got this image from  martin fields overlay plus screen protector      zoom and see that the top and bottom part are left uncovered  note  it doesn't include rear camera coveri will submit picture later so that you can see how it covers the screen   the screen protector attracts a lot of oils and finger print over all it's an ok product but i will surely buy another one maybe this one although it's pricey   mercury color screen protector 
was looking for this type of case for a long time  i have many electronic i can used this with  and all of them fits nice  they are protective and easy accessible for charging  i wish they cold design one that can stand 
its a hard protective case that was desent priced and is very helpfull in every day use of a active person
i got this primarily to be able to charge my galaxy s3 in the car  for that it works very well  cable doesn't work to sync the phone  but it isn't advertised for that 
i bought this cuz i i got the skinit san francisco 49ers retro logo vinyl skin for apple iphone  and this bumper case makes the phone look   and i had a good experience with this site from china they told it was going to be a few months before i got the bumper but i got it with in a few weeks     love it
really like the little pens you can change them out  love the ideal that you can just put it in the top of your phone  and it does not come out
so cute and the rhinestones dont fall off  but however the chains get tangled and gets caught on all things
received on or ahead of schedule   item was as described   looks like a very good deal for the money and ready to protect my over priced electronic anchor       only giving 4 stars at this time  since i haven't tried it out yet and am a bit leary of the corner pieces possibly snapping off in time 
the case is great  no complaints   fit is perfect  and the case is just thick enough to be rigid and strong with no flex   nice white color i knew this was a smooth plastic version  but i wanted to try and it compare to the elago s5 slim fit 2 case  which is soft touch comparing the two  i definitely prefer the soft touch cases to the smooth   slick plastic of this case   i just think it's easier to grip the soft touch surface and am concerned that the smooth plastic may be easier to drop or slide off of a surface if you don't mind the smooth plastic  it's a top notch high quality case 
if you have a samsumg galaxy s2 for t mobile  please get this for your phone  it's a quality case for a great price  i dropped my phone numerous times and nothing because of this case  my sister who bought the phone after i did regret not getting a case because she dropped hers on day 1 and have a huge scratch  now she's going to return it because she have warranty but why go through the hassle and why pay for warranty if you have this case  i highly recommend anyone with this phone to buy this  also this screen protector        
with my galaxy s i had a gel case and the phone itself was lighter   dropped it a couple times and got that bouncy thud   you would have had to slam it down to damage the phone   this one is a completely hard case and it adds some weight to the phone   dropped it twice but there was no damage to the phone   everything works as pictured   the belt clip does not hold the way you'd expect   when i dropped the phone it's because it was bumped up against something while clipped to my belt which knocked it off  the case is surprisingly excellent   keeps the phone safe and the stand works well 
can't beat the price and as most screen protectors they can be tricky to install without any air bubbles showing up   these worked pretty good but took me 2 sheets to get it like i wanted   clean screen and blowing off the underside of the film while applying seems to help with the air bubbles   i'd buy again 
love this but it did cost about 5 50 to shipcame new it is very soft and bright pink
i had the logitech that goes for about the same price and sounds much better than this one    it is not really bad though  and looks great too 
just wanted to post to anyone looking to buy this mount w  for an iphone 4 4s   it works just fine for me   i've read a few reports that it doesnt   well for me it works just fine   i liked this mount so much that i bought two for each of my cars   so on to some specifics    for suction mount  i would say its somewhere between a cheapy one you would find at a kiosk in the mall and a ram mount   if you have or seen a ram mount  those suction cups are huge   so this is a good compromise between the cheapy smaller suction mounts and the ram   the suction has a lever to clamp down the suction mount    the articulation on this mount is pretty good  it has a swiveling mount so you can move the mount horizontally or vertically   it clicks into place and it works well for me   the arm is pretty thick and is just bendable enough to make it easy to bend but still rigid enough to keep it from needlessly bending from gravity or a bump    for the mount arms themselves  the two arms  or whatever you call it  work well   the best way to insert your phone is to angle it in about 45 degs and then push the phone into the other side   this i believe causes the least amount of stress on the arm pivots   the width allows it to accept other phones too   my coworker's galaxy s 2 fits just fine as well   she bought one too after testing mine out 
i bought this as a gift for my dad   it was a good product   easy to put on and i do feel that it protects the phone pretty well  he dropped it a few times already  and the phone seems to be okay still 
got this case for my daughter and she love the case  and is looking forward on having me order more in the near future
i am thrilled to finally have a longer cord to charge my ipad 2  i have a pink case for it  so i was thrilled to find a pink cord  i tried the black one first  it worked fine  then i tried the pink  it wouldn't fit  i was annoyed thinking that i was going to have to send it back to hong kong for  ore than i paid for it     but  my boyfriend fiddled with it  and got it to fit  the prongs on the side were just too rigid  i have to pinch them together myself to make it fit  but it does fit now both colors charge fine for me  but they do seem to charge slower than the charger cord that came with the ipad  they look a little cheap  buy hey  they work 
after observing a co workers mini jambox  i decided to get myself one   amazon provided me with the best pricing option  better than sam's club  and i feel comfortable buying from prime vendors so   i'm very pleased with this product  i have it paired to my iphone 4s  my third gen ipad  and my macbook air   the paring process is incredibly easy and  there are no issues once paired  the connection is completely static free and works well even from another room the box produces surprisingly good sound with more than one might expect from it's size   this is the smaller version but it easily provides a great companion to pandora  it also works very well as a conference call box  bosley would be very proud  with separate volume controls directly on the top of the unit i've noticed that there is a communication between the box and phone  the battery capacity is displayed on the phone  or pad  when connected  quite a pleasant surprise  speaking to the battery  i've used this for over a week  it's still 3 4 charged   it seems that even when i leave it turned on overnight  there's no  or minimal  draw on the battery when the unit is not actively playing music so  audiophiles  this is a little speaker  don't expect it to be a bose radio or blow your hifi out of the water  that's not what it's for   it is a very portable  convenient external speaker that  given the size  produces very pleasant high and low tones when i selected this  i looked online to see how the various wireless bluetooth speakers stacked up  and i am very pleased with this purchase 
got it as a second battery for travel and camping   works as well if not better than the original samsung battery   very pleased 
this is a cute case but i hate hard cases cause the are difficult 2 take out ur phone  specially with this one since it has a lot of bling u can't use ur teeth cause u might make them fall off   it comes with some replacements stones    so far so good
the phone is great and i can see the numbers and it is for me  it got to me just when they tell you that it is coming and it was easy to add my phone number to it 
my husband wanted a leather case that was professional looking and not bulky that he could wear on his belt  most belt holsters are pretty bulky  he uses this one with his iphone 5 in a spigen case and it fits rather loose but it wasn't really made for it and he's still happy with it  if you were using it with the otterbox i'm sure it would fit better 
unlike my nexus 5 tpu cover this doesn't attract too much dust  it also has a fashionable android logo on the exterior to let everyone see you rockin' an android device in the sea of iphones 
this was the easiest installation just yet and within several hours the screen became clear  you cannot tell  only by close inspection  i have a scree protector on the moto x this is my 7th armorsuit and have installed on more that 30 devices  have recommended to anyone that ask about this type of product i have become an expert installing it and it is quite simple if you follow the steps armorsuit has upload to youtube the first two installation  htc g1  weren't that good and it took about 10 days for all the fuzziness to go away and for the screen to become clear i always install them as soon as the protective plastic is removed from a device 
nice set easy to pair almost perfect but so far a music or in a noisy area the volume sucks  i was listening to pandora and went to the shop area and the regular noise drowned out the music  i feel more secure with the ear loop   the earpiece fit is uncomfortable or loose which doesnt help the volume issue  i like to listen to music so it leaves something to be desired in that area  also taking in to accout the fit issues it looks rather   34 odd  34  and sits off my ear looking unprofessional and bulky i am more than likely returning this one and shop for something else  i have used or went thru a lot of bluetooth devices sound battery life and fit appearance is important to me
they have outdone themselves on this one   i wish this was a name brand  because my next phone will have the same one   latches tightly  nice size  what more could you want 
i don't think this is a new battery but it did its job in helping me get my contacts out of an old phone came with someone of a charge i was also able to get all my pictures so for the price and quality it did its job
they do their job  the fit could be better  but i'm not complaining  they are easy to install and they stay put 
you only get one and they choose the color for you  the gem is almost falling out  it wasn't in any package beside the shipping package  i wasted my money on this product and will never buy from them again  very disappointed  
this is possibly one of the easiest to use cell phone contraption i used  it's usage is mainly to get a strong signal at areas where you have sketchy signals  it maintains 5 bars as the name suggests you simply plug the device into your power source in the car and fuggedaboutit  a snap to use in the car when on the go as well as at home recommended 
item broke almost instantly  the material is super thin and will not hold up for anything  i guess you get what you pay for     
bought this for friends trip  figuring he would need it for work  he likes it and uses it more than he anticipated  also he says he worries less about the phone while in the case  hard part is he doesn't wear a belt very often   but the clip works on the waist band 
i don't write too many reviews but felt compelled to write this one because this case is so good   i have had this case on my phone for 3 months now   i love my nokia e71 and want to keep it for a long time   i tried a  leather  case that had clear plastic over the screen  and it ended up scratching my screen protector  glad i had that installed     i searched for other cases and almost bought a standard silicon case but just didn't like how  sticky  they feel when trying to put in one's pocket and how they don't always fit tightly this case solves both problems   the silicone protects the phone nicely  while the plastic  shell  provides reinforcement increasing the protection and giving it a very solid feel   with the plastic shell  the silicone fits tightly  and one can insert the phone in one's pocket without much problem   none of the keys on the keyboard are obstructed  all of the buttons and ports work just fine with this case on   i happened to drop the phone for the first time this week on a concrete basement floor  and the case did it's job   phone is working just fine with no damage scratches the only issues i have with this case are   i would like a little more of the silicon to be revealed on the back of the case to help prevent sliding off of tables  desks  etc   the area along the upper left side near the memory card slot usb port and the screen is a little bit too thin and makes me wonder if this will rip off eventually   i think there is plenty of room to increase the material here while sill allowing for access to these ports 
i returned this after the first use it didn't charge 100  after more than 12 hours  and also didn't complete charging my gs3 two times  which is less than 4200 mahthe build quality is good though
  my car phone holder that is    something so simple as a little plastic and rubber  makes life a whole lot easier   another product well done   
i own this headset and theplantronics m50   bluetooth headset   retail packaging   blackand i love both of them  though  i actually prefer this one for my small and sensitive ears  it seems to be a bit smaller than the m50 and the ear hook also seems a bit smaller  it fits me much better this is also very comfortable in my ear unlike many bluetooth devices which always tended to fall out of my ear  i have very sensitive ears and even wearing ear bud headphones bothers my ears  this headset is actually very comfortable for me to wear for extended amounts of time  i also like the feature that you can wear it comfortably in either ear by flipping the ear wrap i'd highly recommend 
let me say a few things buy this device   here are the reasons   7 8 hours talk time  true 30 feet range  wind filter for clear talking  small and comfortable  doesn't intrude your ear  crazy price  huge quality  warranty and reliability of logitech i've used a sony ericsson and jabra bt200 and i would say the jabra is much better than sony ericsson  but the logitech blows them both away   it's faster to put on the logitech and the range is much better   the microphone is clear and crisp and the speaker volume is loud and sufficient for me  i used a jabra a210 bluetooth adapter for a sprint sanyo 8100 phone w 2 5mm headset jack   it gave me bt on my phone so i could use this headset   the auto answer and hang up depends on your phone whether it would normally do so with a headset or not   works great for me if you are considering a headset  get this one   it's what bluetooth technology should be like   it's so great that amazon sold out     nice   it was  39 99  where did they all go    
i am very impressed with the arkon supercharge docking mount  it was easy to put together  and simple to attach to the windshield  the unit feels very sturdy  and the suction mount remained firmly on the windshield after hours of driving over bumpy roads   it also includes a disk that can be attached with double sided cushioned tape which would allow you to mount the phone somewhere on your dash   my iphone slid easily onto the charging dock  and was held firmly in place by the expanding top latch  the latch is spring loaded  so it pops up when you push a button on the left side of the unit  allowing the phone to be easily released  my phone has a protective case  and it fit onto the cradle with no problems  the cradle allows easy adjustment of the angle to view your phone  and it can also change from portrait to landscape mode  the included car charging cord plugs into the side of the cradle with a mini usb connector  and is long enough to reach a dash outlet in most vehicles  this is the perfect compliment to using the navigation feature on the iphone  i took it with me on a trip and used it in my rental car instead of renting a gps unit  i highly recommend this supercharge docking mount 
this case is similar to the iphone 4 otterbox reflix series  it's sturdy but light   the only negative is that it does not protect from water basically i only want otterboxes to protect my phone
it looks nothing like the display  its cheap and the picture is misleading  do not buy it  waste of money 
i got this for my husband who is an otr truck driver  he says it hasn't given him any trouble as of yet  he uses the otter box defender for his phone and it fits just fine in this stand 
this screen protector looks very nice when it is on  really  shiny  so why 4 stars and not 5  for one  i was unable to put it on without bubbles on my first and second tries  so it's a good thing they send three screen protectors  but still  frustrating  and for another  it seems the nexus 4 screen has an ever so slight curvature at the edges of the screen and so the screen protector  misses  an ever so small but perceptible part of the left and right of the front panel  not the actual screen  just the left and right edges of the front  glass   the protective case i useb009y10tzmcovers the edges and so it looks perfect now 
these screen protectors are very useful and are a lot cheaper than the name brand ones  they work just as well  just be careful when you install them 
as a person that switches between phones a lot this set is very handy  i use my nano sim card in every phone now without any worries of messing my sim card 
decent screen protector  fits nexus 5 correctly  purchased as a combo with phone and screen protector  using for over a month now
these are great covers  i got 3 but so far have only had to use 1  i know who to recommend anytime some one is looking for phone covers  these are definitely worth the price 
after 2 years of the iphone with minimal personalization  no multiple apps  crummy reception and excessive dropped calls  i could not be happier with my captivate  i have yet to have a call dropped  great screen  battery life is reasonable if you manage it  there is a bit of adjustment to it  but apple is no longer telling me how and when to use my phone  it's light but sturdy  it's a shame this phone is not getting more attention 
the case looks good due to keeping the back see through   only gripe is the middle always show some sort of oil residue like spot no matter how much it's clean 
while also looking stylish this case holds my iphone securely and definitely keeps it safe from scratches or hard knocks from being dropped  i love how the camera cover can be swiveled out of the way and does not have to be held with a finger while you try to take a picture or video  this is my third griffin case and i love them all  the only thing you might need to know is that you can not use the apple lightning to 30 pin adapter as the case has hard plastic in the way  there's no issue with using any other lightning items  just the wide adapter won't fit 
well it works  its a thick screen protector and really noticeable  but i'd rather have a big ugly screen protector on the phone  than a big ugly scratch 
i purchased several batteries from my phone   these are packed with battery   comparing them to other so called 1800mah batteries this is awsome   they are bigger   yes it is a tight fit   they are heavier   you can feel it in your hand   this is what you need   i am getting about 20 percent more power than the stock and other replacemnets   based on the battery app i have the measures and gives you time used and how much is used   i will not buy any other battery   this is the one for all my phones 
great case to protect the phone  i however don't like it to much only cuz its to bulky for me i prefer a snap on slim case 
nice case  fits snugly and the blue trim looks sharp contrasted with my black s4   score  5 stars but even at the amazon discounted price  at the time of this review it cost about  17 00  it's overpriced by about  5   score  2 star deduction if you use a screen protector please be aware that the lip of the case may not overlap with the screen protector  may or may not be important to you  but it is for me  i've found with cases like this if the screen protector doesn't go all the way to the edge there is a good chance it  the screen pro  will get caught and lifted up  perhaps a minor issue  until it happens     summary  3 stars  nice case  but over priced 
so  i didn't receive what i had ordered  but the company was amazing about getting me what i needed  they made what could have been a very stressful event  hassle free   the pens are really cute and bright colors   everyone is jealous of them  definitely worth buying    
mechanically  thiskmashi 2800mah flashlight portable power bank kmax 807  looks nearly identical to several similar products i have tested  including theswift gear 2600mah external battery packandkickbot pb2610  electrically  there are several features i like about this kmashi unit   it has a 4 led battery status indicator  instead of just one led for other units   it has auto on off feature  the unit powers up automatically after you connect a load to its usb device  it powers off in about 6 seconds if no load is detected   the standby current is very low at just 0 3ma according to the back of the box  that means it can have a shelf life of up to 1 year   it advertises higher capacity of '2800mah' vs  2600mah for other products upon closer examination  however  i discovered several minor problems with the kmashi unit 1  the measured capacity is lower when using a 5 ohm power resistor as load  the unit is able to deliver 0 94a at 4 9v  or 4 6w of power for 87 minutes  this gives a total output energy of 6 67wh  according to my calculation  the internal battery has a capacity of 2250mah  or just 80  of advertised value  in contrast  the kickbot and swift gear units' internal batteries were measured at around 2500 2600mah  all capacities are estimated assuming 80  conversion efficiency   see the chart i uploaded to 'customer images' section for runtime comparision 2  the battery status indicator is highly non linear according to the instruction sheet  each of the 4 leds should represent 25  of charge  my actual observations were very different   4 led   90 to 100   3 led   71 to 89   2 led   51 to 70   1 led   15 to 50   1 blinking led   under 15 3  the led flashlight is relatively weak when compared to other units  its beam has roughly the same brightness as that of an old fashioned 2xaa penlight  the up side is that it has a much longer runtime  the instruction sheet claims 72 hours  compared to just 10 20 hours i estimated for other two units  note  you have to press and hold the power button for 3 seconds to turn on off the flashlight overall  this is still a good power bank unit to consider   if you can get it at a lower price than other similar products  i would have given it a 5 star rating if its capacity rating were more accurate 
i lost my charger that came w  my android phone so i hopped on amazon and found this sweet deal  seriously i saved a good  10  15 compared to what sprint would have tried to charge me or bestbuy or whatever  bottom line is this works great and i didn't pay very much for it    
very easy to use  it does what it should do  total length is about 2 feet  given its price  i give 5 star 
perfect accessorie  love it  i drive my yamaha at 95 mph without windshield and keep my s4 perfectly  safe and on the right position 
it is a great case for protection  it adds a few centimeters but it fits snug an secure so it will definitely protect from dropping  however  the rubber around the outside wears away over time on some but not all for some reason  i think certain colors hold up better than others because this is a very common case 
i don't really like the look but my phone is very protected  also the price is one of a kind  no matter where i go it costs a lot more 
i bought it because of the simple look  i own a white s3  and because it came with a kickstand  the kickstand was great and worked well using a snapping mechanism but after about 8 months the plastic stand snapped off so i just had a random hole in the middle of my case  aside from that it protected my phone from various drops so i can't complain about that 
i bought this for my husband iphone  within the first 2 days the plastic chrome piece came off  within a month the black   34 paint  34  faded and rubbed off on his fingers when he held the phone  definitly wouldn't buy again
if you own a newer generation smart phone  you have to use a charger that has enough power to recharge your phone while it is running   i used my old droid car charger with the navigation on  bluetooth on  and wifi on  after about an hour the phone battery was near dead   this charger supplies more power   you need every bit of it to power and charge the newer generation smart phones 
my pens were packaged very well  journeyed all the way from china without a scratch  pretty good quality pens  for the money   now i can stop using my finger 
pros  snug  factory like fit around phone gives the delicate  flimsy construction of the blackberry 9900 a solid  more robust feel  browsing your phone no longer feels as if you're going to snap it in half  will protect the phone in most   34 normal  34  scenarios tried and tested by many others  approval by consensus  reviews widely availablecons  may not fit original holster
i have another very similar case to this one  the poetic hardback case that opens to the side  this case was honestly purchased to get my order over the  25 for free shipping  i was pleased when i received this case  the build quality is a bit better than the other case and the more i use it the more i like the vertical flip as opposed to the book style of the poetic i find the vertical flip much easier to use one handed  i can use my index finger to press the clasp off of the top of the phone then just let the case fall open  to close i simply flip the cover back up and press it closed with my thumb  i could sort of open the poetic with one hand and some finger acrobatics but i was always worried that i would drop the phone this case is also slightly thinner than the poetic which is nice when in my pocket  i have a feeling i will be using this case a lot as the weather gets warmer and i will be carrying my phone in my pocket instead of my evest  this case will protect my screen while in my pocket as a bumper or tpu case will not it's a great case for a great price 
fits well and protects my phone but the color does not stay bright for more than a week or so with normal use 
made of cheap plastic but will do the job   i don't think it will hold up for the long haul  so if you looking for something temporary   then go for it   it's cheap but functional 
this came nice and heavy material but the first one i had to scrap it because it had a flow in the material so it was not crystal clear  second one was no problem installing        the best way to install this is don't use there way first align the protector on the phone screen second on the right side of the phone apply tape to the protector and phone so it keeps it in place third lift the protector and remove 1 4 of the bottom film  then use a credit card and slowly press on top of the protector going from right side to the left side and at the same time continue removing the rest of the film and any bubbles forth remove tape that you applied and continue rubbing until all bubbles are out  there should not be too many of them  after that remove the second film and you all set 
i got this needing something that can take punishment  of course everyone said get box but something was telling me for the price this would work  i put this thing through hell  i promise you  i mow for a living  i mow from 9 10 hours a day  i also do some landscaping  i clean this case once a week  at the end of the week this thing is covered in grass  i have to use my finger nails and scrape crusted grass off the case i use a clorox wipe to clean the plastic and rubber parts  i let them dry and it goes back looking brand new  oh and i for got to mention  after that long ass week  my iphone is in perfect shape  i mean straight out of the box perfect  if you don't mind your little iphone having some bulkiness then your fine  i will buy another if needed  but ive had this for 3 months now and its as good as new it is the real deal 
this case came in within 5 days of ordering  it's very stylish  as for protection  i've dropped my phone once or twice and it hasn't cracked  luckily   if you're looking for stylish but not as worried about protection i recommend this case 
the product was professionally packaged with instructions  on the inside of the box   detergent squirt bottle  plastic water scrapper and skin itself  the skin fit the face of the nexus s perfectly  it took me two tries to get the skin to align the skin perfectly on the face of the nexus  you have to be very precise to get it to fit perfectly  i dont even realize this skin is on my nexus after all the water dried out 
i thought it wouldn't hold the phone properly  i was wrong  this is fully functional  firmly gripping my iphone  now i could open the map and drive carefree  i would highly recommend it if you need to look iphone a lot while driving 
this item came on time and was packaged well i love how it is made make the phone very protected and gives it a nice grip  also love the kickstand    thank you
i got this for my wife's iphone 5c     and she loved it    its awesome for the price and looks great i see only two problems with the case 1  the flip case has suction cups to keep it closed  however  this can spoil the screen guard over a period of time 2  no opening for speakers  so you cannot keep the flap closed while talking on phone
there's not much to say  i received them  they were exactly as advertised and they stick very well   they do not come off easily and i would recommend 
the glow part is not very bright  but it protects and that is why i bought it  satisfied with it regardless 
for a  11 12 product i expected alot more than this  the design and concept are fine  however the plastic feels thin and fragile and the rubber trim started to come off in less than a month returned the product to amazon edit  after trying the izel stand that costs twice as much i may end up getting this stand again  the icarpus is much easier to use and adjust  i just wish the stand was not so flimsy and made of tougher material 
there's even room for error  ex  uneven placement   for people who suck at putting on screen protectors like me     because the way this plastic is cut  it's a tad bit smaller so if you accidentally put it unevenly   still looks good  at least for me 
this is a regular sim card cut with a sim card cutter  it works just fine with my samsung galaxy s3   thank you
great for laughs dont use it in bright light as the screen will stay mirrored otherwise works as advertised totally worth it
it charged as other ordinary external power charger  i used it and found that it only charged up to 30  of the batt 
my daughter is training for her first half marathon and couldn't stand silence   with her music library already on her iphone  it made perfect sense for her to find a way to jog with her music   so we did the research and found this version from tuneband it is very important that you purchase the right style for the type of product you are going to use it for   the headphone plug for the iphone is in a different location than the ipod   so read carefully before you click and save yourself any return hassles this silicone skinned model is very comfortable   the elastic band is adjustable and can easily accommodate different sized arms   the cover does a great job of holding the iphone in place   no worries about if flinging off during your jog   this unit is also open on the front ensuring when you press a button it works overall   this has been an excellent purchase and is highly recommended 
i bought this for an htc g2  which  i thought  was the same as the htc vision  i guess it's not  as the battery seems to be just a tad too big for the phone  still works though  so it's not that big of a deal  just a cosmetic thing 
love  love  love this stylus  i will never use anything but this one  and i have tried so many  on both ends of this stylus is mesh not that rubber stuff  it also has a pen as part of the stylus  one tip on the stylus is bigger than the other  it's small   which i personally prefer    the larger tip is replaceable  but i was very upset that you can't change the smaller one when it wears out  i hope at some point the company can change that  the pen  works great and so handy   if your at the doctors and have to fill out the papers they need you won't have to use one of the   34 germy  34  ones they have and then go back to what you were doing on your ipad  so great  for me this stylus gives the best of everything and is worth every penny 
takes too long to charge the note 3  output is less than half of the plug in charger  very disappointed
this is great   i use this as my regular charger because it has a longer cord than the one that came with my phone   i use the original charger at my desk at work   good purchase 
this battery got my phone back the way it used to be  before i couldn't keep a charge  with this battery it doubled my cell life  great purchase 
if fits snugly and looks sleek  the striped design looks classy   i like that the top is open  rather than punched holes for the mic opening  because my car adapter fits with no issue  the bottom is also open so the charger slot and speaker are totally accessible  kickstand is sturdy and easy to use  and works vertically and horizontally  recommend with no reservations  
not sure what the deal is    i think i cancel one of these cuz i accidentally order two but have not seen it yet so i'm thinking  might have cancelled both    no clue 
the case doesn't have as many colored polka dots as shown  the white part of the case will get dirty with time  other than that  i like the case 
i've had a nexus 4 since it's been released  and this has been the only case i've used   it's protected my phone from a good number of drops   always with the phone coming out unscathed   granted  i wouldn't be tossing this out of a 10th floor window  but for day to day in and out of pockets  a few drops from a desk  and a few more fumbles  it's done its job in protecting my phone 
well i bought a few of these cables so e worked and some did not i believe i bought five but those are the chances u take 3 of the 5 worked so i am happy paid close to nothing somy complain
this is the best case ever slim and light for the iphone5 5s  greasy and shine great money value i recommend it 
i don't know why i continue to buy these mics  i have had 4 of them and every single one has died after a few months   microsoft knows there is a battery issue yet they refuse to fix it
i keep it on my keychain since i get my iphone taken up in school every week  i just pop out my sim card and hand my phone over  i always keep 2 spare iphone fours in my backpack  the teacher gives me a dirty look when i remove my sim card 
i would recommend this case to anyone who's looking for a thin sleek case  i've used the speck case  amzer argyle case  and tpu high gloss black case  this is the case i like the most out of all them  it fits in the laptop dock without having to take the case off  my second choice would be the tpu high gloss black  that case offers a little more protection and covers the volume control  however  the incipio is much sleeker in design and the fingerprint scanner is not obstructed 
i bought one for my phone to test it out   i love it  and then my wife wanted one so i ordered her one as well and it also works great  you have 2 satisfied customersu cant beat the price w  all the warranty they give
i love this case 1  it's an otterbox 2  i can fit it into a pants pocket and the smooth case doesn't stick or attract lint 3  it offers a good grip when using it for ichat and as a camera 4  i've dropped my phone and the case did it's job   no damage 5  it's a split case  so i can slide off the bottom half and drop it into a dock 
when i first assembled the extra arms  not shown in official product image  i felt like they made the mount look cheap and chintzy  now i pretty much ignore them       okay  so what is this thing and how does it work and does it make your car look stupid  or cool well  on the fashion side i definitely like the look shown in the official product image  the round base is a suction cup mount that attaches to your windshield with ease and stays attached extremely well  so far so good  there is a slight problem with the design in that the arm phone mount bounces around a lot  so much that your phone may well drop while driving  my galaxy s3 has a few times and it is a hazard  flying phone   this might not be a problem with a lighter phone  such as an ipod 4 the way the phone attaches is that the dark rectangle in the middle of the face of the mounting plate is some kind of miracle super sticky goo  think   34 rat trap tar  34   that grabs your phone and holds on to it like pine sap  what is impressive is that the   34 goo  34  does not transfer to your phone  the instructions say to rotate  or even twist your phone a bit to loosen the bond before pulling  do not pull straight out  or you will pull your phone away from the back cover  which will stay attached to this  it is remarkably easy to use  slap your phone on it and good luck getting it off  until you hit a bump and for some reason the phone flies off i want to give this 4 stars  the idea is excellent  the execution is about 80  there  and as i mentioned  the goo leaves no residue on your phone  that part is cool  it is just the habit of the phone falling off while driving  even while it is a challenge to take it off manually  with your hands   after a few tries you get the hang of dislodging it  but there is an art to it  then there is the issue of the arms they just look dumb  do they give the phone something to rest on  yes  and that helps keep the phone from flying  but it seems redundant  either trust your sticky miracle goo or give us little support arms  but both seems like overkill  and the arms are just rounded off   34 l  34  shaped bits of plastic bar you snap into the ends or sides of the mount  the instructions are a bit weak on all of this  they show you how to  but do not explain which way you should do it if you want your phone vertical or horizontal  i ended up going at an angle so that i could have the   34 l  34  shaped support plastic arms cradling the phone  is it better than having your phone in your lap  yes  and the suction cup sticks to the windshield  the mount rotates nicely on a ball joint for many viewing angles  which may be why it is so bouncy   but i have not yet gotten it to stick to my dashboard  perhaps i need something smoother for the price it is nice  i would try it without the arms first  but watch out for flying phones  anyway  thanks for reading  i hope this helps 
they fit perfect easy to put on and very nice for the price  they haven't peeled yet and have had it on for a few months now
the pandamimi deluxe case cover is a clear plastic cover embossed with multiple faux gems on a gold colored base   the gold based gem pattern is very beautiful and visually striking   the pattern is not flat with the cover but raised appreciably from the cover itself   the gems are affixed to the case and the manufacturer provides a tube of glue to repair any gems that come loose my wife found the actual case to be really amazing when she first saw it   when she placed her phone in it and held it in her hand  she was less impressed   it felt awkward to her   she felt the actual case fit wasn't as pleasing as her older protective case and it doesn't have a lip that wraps around the case   she was hoping the case would provide a protective edge on the front of the phone so when the phone is lying face down on a table it is not lying directly on the front screen   the case is made of rigid plastic and not flexible  which makes its rigidity prone to cracking if stressed so she has reverted back to her old case and luckily our toddler has taken a shine to the case   he loves to hold it in his hands and play with it and is fascinated by all the jewels   we supervise his play time in case any gems come loose one word of caution for those ordering this case  the case took almost three weeks to arrive   the vendor who sold us the case send it from hong kong  china   depending on your country of origin  it can take a number of weeks to arrive on your doorstep while this review wasn't glowing  we do want to reiterate how beautiful this case is   it really is very attractive and eye catching   the three things that my wife didn't like was 1  the gem pattern is raised high off the case  2  the cover is totally rigid and not flexible  and 3  the case does not wrap around the phone and provide a raised edge to protect the front screen if it is placed on its face   lastly  shipping was very slow for us citizens  since the case is shipped from hong kong  china 
dry installation is cleaner and easier than wet installation screen protectors  great product for the money  the only brand i use for my apple products   the matte finish is great because it prevents glare and is oil resistant  so it does not attract fingerprints 
the batteries are working fine  the plug in charger was  real handy while it worked  the construction was very bad  i guess when the battery is finished charging it a spring will move the electric contacts to stop the charging  well this broke and it stopped charging  but the batteries are fine 
funciona a al perfecci oacute n   carga muy bien el galaxy s 3   le da mayor tiempo de autonomia  
it fitted perfectly to my iphone 3gs  but just one day and it was dirty  i would go for a black one  good quality and resistant 
great case  i have dropped my phone soooo many times and this protects it great  it does muffle it a bit so be prepared for that  if you're like me you rarely use your phone to talk so it doesn't matter to me but might to others 
i purchased this to go w  motorola portable charger  it was a must as the charger on it's own  the connections didn't fit fine product  great price  timely delivery 
bought another one on line earlier but was a slightly smaller  7a charge   it would do my galaxy 3 but very  very slowly   this is a full 1 0a and does the number for me  fully and long lasting   as you look for a backup charger to the one samsung gives you in the mfr box  this is the one to pick up 
considering the limited case options for a device not yet released in the states  this is probably the best choice currently available   the case itself fits like a glove and provides protection against external scratches  but limited protection against drops on the floor as expected looks great  feels tight  and all the holes line up to the external buttons and the camera flash   however  i might still replace this with an otter case when released for increase protection with the tiered hard soft shell combo   in the mean time  this will do the trick 
so great so great so great  the pen is nice easy to hold the red and black ink is cool and the stylus is precise 
battery cases for iphones assume  of course  that you spend a good part of your time on the move or  at any rate  away from convenient charging points  since that's not an issue for me right now  the bulk and weight this spyder case adds to the iphone is not something i feel the need to make a permanent part of the thing i carry around  when i travel  though  or figure i'll spend most of the day away from home  however  i can absolutely see my phone donning this suit like iron man or at leastthe rocketeer attaching the battery case makes the iphone a little bit taller  slightly more than a little bit thicker  and rather more than a little bit heavier  but the case is at least well integrated and doesn't look bad  the rounded back actually feels pretty nice  and it's good to know  too  that the included sync dock is a convenience  not a necessity  you can attach the charging cable  which is different from the apple ma591g b dock connector to usb sync and charging cable for iphone ipad ipod  directly to your phone and it will charge both the case and your phone 
this product does fit the samsung galaxy s3 nicely it is an inexpensive pouch the threads start to unravel at the edges with use 
this case is made of a one piece plastic  it is so durable and can be washed if needed  i just love this case  it looks amazing on my phone 
skinomi techskins are the best  application takes a little time and patience  but the wet application process makes it easier and more forgivable  so just follow the directions carefully  and once it's on  your device is well protected  while the surface is shiny  it's not as shiny as a brand new device  but the skin is also a little  grippy  so it can help you hold on to your device better  too  which means less chance of a drop and smash   they are optically clear  so there is no interference with seeing what's on your screen  and self healing  so if it does get a scratch  it quickly fades away  there are only two issues i have with them  first  some of the port and feature cutouts weren't quite perfectly placed  and  second  i wish devices came with skins on them from the factory second thoughts  after several weeks with the protector  i put my phone into my belt case  and edge of the skin caught on the case and peeled back  it hasn't been the same since   also  although it makes the phone easier to hold on to  it also reduces the responsiveness of the screen  and  since it is not completely smooth  it mars the beauty of the nexus 4's back   i am looking for a different protector now 
i've used the tech armor premium high definitioin  hd  shields on my samsung galaxy s4 and love the smooth glasslike quality they had to them  so when i purchased an unlocked samsung galaxy s3 mini for travel abroad i was glad that tech armor made the same cover shields for this model  i quickly purchased them and added them to this phone  crystal clear  smooth to run your finger over  great screen protection 
i love the majority of samsung accessories for gs3  this gs3 charging dock is  however  a little disappointed  unlike the what the name  multimedia desktop charging dock  shouts  it lacks most of the major  multimedia  features  i do have to admit that samsung always have very good taste od aesthetic  this unit looks so simple yet so elegant and beautiful  the sweet spot that i place this is next to my surround sound receiver  i connect it to my receiver so i can listen to pandora on my phone through the system in the house   it does make my system look more luxurious and high tech  sitting among other electronics other than good looking  everything else is pretty average  first  as a  multimedia dock   i thought it would come with an digital out  hdmi out  or at least with some type of cable  nope  it only has an analog stereo headphones out  and power input  no cable included  not even 3 5mm extender  second  the dock does has some weight on it  but for a fairly large phone like the s3  it need some more weight  when i have my s3 plugged in  the whole thing become top heavy  just a slightest move of the power cable would tip my phone over  i ended up using two sided tape to keep it stick to the surface of my tv stand  the charging port door is designed to sit flush down when closed  to open  at first i thought it was spring lock action so i keep pushing down where the  samsung  letters is  i then realized it was manual  and opening it is now really easy  the charging port does not give that  click  indicating phone is locked in when i plug my phone in  maybe it's just my phone  audio quality from the stereo port is not the best but acceptable  it does output some tiny static or whistle when phone volume is at max and power cable is plugged in i love the look of this charging dock and would definitely pay that  50 range if it had at least an hdmi out  as is  imo  it should be in  20 range  
my fiance loves this case  and loves the protection it gives  he wishes that the rubber case was a little more durable  he works construction so the rubber case tears easily 
this charger port filled a need for my family   with 4 cell phones  plus tablets and kindles  we often need to charge devices in the car  and at often we need to charge more than one   plus  now i only need to have this plus two usb to microusb cables  rather than a variety of car adaptors this installed easily in my cigarette lighter port  and does not slip out   all of our devices charge fine with no issues  at basically the same rates that they would charge in the house on wall chargers   the bright color makes it easy to find in the car if it gets removed from the dash the y angle of the two usb ports has an unexpected issue   each arm of the y easily gets caught on things  like purses  backpacks  even my sleeve   i think this would have been better designed as a box with two ports the only thing i don't care for with tylt products in general is how they overpackage their products with layer upon layer of different plastics   now  granted  they all have a recycle symbol on them  but the products really don't need all this extra packaging to be distinctive 
i love the color of this case  bright and cheery  the rubber cover is sturdy and the phone fits perfectly  didn't have any trouble getting the phone in and it is nice and snug  hope it protects my phone good  delivery was very fast  got here day before estimated delivery date  i would recommend this seller to my friends 
i love my cover it was very good looking on my phone and everyone loved the look  the anchor remindsme the that i am anchored in jesus  it a good protective covering also in a variety of colors
this smartphone cover is excellent  i really like it because it gives better protection to my smartphone  this is soft  it's easy donning the phone  protects well  in short  always buy this product to protect my iphone 
perfect for the car   retractable  flexible and durable 
exactly as its description states   clearly the best case i've ever bought and honestly  i've bought way too many  one of my issues with every case and or wallet out there for the iphone is that they a  bulk up the iphone and b  take away from the sleek beauty of an iphone by covering up every inch of the phone   i'm not looking to shield my phone from the world by incasing it in armor  this case  however  almost appears as if nothing is on the iphone at all though it is protected  it's still very slim  how i like it  and the matte finish is perfect  love the cutout for the apple  bought this in navy too and both colors are great  perfect match to the black iphone and the navy color is so deep that it matches the apple logo on the back of the phone  awesome case honestly and fantastic price 
want a galaxy case with a belt clip and as small as possible  this one is great except it has the silicone on the inside and hard shell on the outside  the outer shell is completely smooth and slick  would drop this just as easily as holding the phone by itself   best box though  better than blason prime and transformer smaller than otterbox but too slippery  guess i am stuck with the bigger more expensive otter because it has silicone on the outside 
i bought this to charge my duracell powermat gopower overnighter  i don't own an i phone  my smart phone is a sumsung s4 and i bought a wireless power back for it  but haven't figured how to get the s4 directly charged by this powermat  it does charge the gopower overnighter in a resonable time  it's small and i like the way the power cord raps around the transformer  so it is not tangled with all the other cords  the transformer itself is narrow so doesn't hog space on the power strip  it is rather expensive purchase just to power my gopower  but more reasonable if you can easily repower your i phone  or can figure out how to make the wireless charge power back work with my galaxy s4  any suggestions  
just like the stock battery  fits just fine and holds a charge  hopefully this one lasts longer than just the year that the stock battery lasted  but if not  it's cheap enough i don't mind replacing it 
i like that it is a strong charger  and well the light up eyes look really cool  wanna order another one but it's a little much  maybe next pay check  i would recommend to all cell phone users 
bought this for my hubby as an extra case   he hasn't used it yet  but it seems just fine   it is hard plastic   seems durable 
wow  this thing is nice  i love the way it protects my purchase  the handy kickstand is nice as well  all that and it looks good too 
i like the case only thing is the plastic loose but  other then that it is a nice case and it works for me 
got this to cut a micro sim down to nano for my moto x and it beat the hell out of my previous technique of using a pair of scissors to manually cut a card 
i really love this one   i was hoping that it was more sturdy   i just love the blings and the skull is a eye catcher   i will order more like this   i would love to find one with bling in many colors 
first i want to start by saying that i have had an iphone since launch date of 2007  i always loved my iphone and i have bought every generation of it including the iphone 4s  slowly i have been getting bored with the iphone  when i saw what was coming with ios 6 i was disappointed since i thought they where going to introduce really cool things that the os would do  i then saw the keynote from samsung about the galaxy s3 and i was blown away  i thought this is what the iphone 5 should be i ended up selling my iphones and bought a galaxy for me  my wife and my son  we love the phone  we have had the phone for over 1 month now and its amazing  the screen is awesome  the battery life is very good for me  it last me almost all day  the fact that i can swap out the battery is great  i have used other android phones in the past and they suck  this one with ice cream sandwich just works  if you are looking for a change than this is it after looking at the photos of what the iphone 5 is going to be like i feel i made the right choice  i don't want a phone that is just longer it needs to be wider  apple should have made it at least a 4 3 screen the only complaint i have about this phone is that when i put it a holster it starts getting hot  most android phones do that and i think its because since it has real multitasking the apps stay running all the time unlike the iphone where the apps are paused i can tell you that i can do things on this phone that the iphone does not allow  that alone was getting me on the fence  lastly this model has 16gb onboard and i was able to buy a microsd card with 64gb  now i have 80gb  i love that the storage is expandable 
the cover fits very snug on the iphone 5  the only issue we have come into contact with it is if you have a screen saver it tends to slowly peel it off around the edges   other than that it is a great cover and ads no bulk to the phone   i would recommend this item 
this little flashlight is designed for emergency situations   it is lightweight and comes equipped with several plugs for various devices  both ipad iphone and more conventional devices   the light is bright enough for emergencies and has four types of light   a standard light  a brighter light  a blinking light and flashing light   it carries well in one hand   a blue light indicates the device is fully charged my device already came charged  which was nice   but i have no idea how many cycles this flashlight charger will go through before it  too  dies   for the price this is a very practical device and can be easily added to a backpack  camera phone bag  travel bag for those times when light is important i was provided a free sample to review 
this is by far the best phone i have ever owned  there are some things i wish came right on the phone and other things i wish i could just take off of the phone  but over all the phone works great and i love it nonetheless 
i agree with the other poster  why blame the phone because you broke the screen  is the monitor at home bad because you dropped it off the table  the phone is the best smart phone out there  people have had issues with resets  but that is more of a conflict with the many apps that you can load on it and usually can be solved  i love this phone  also   do not rate 1 star and then say the phone is good  but verizon is bad  that is unfair since it lowers the over all rating  ignore the guy who broke his phone   this is a very good phone 
the belkin car charger with lightning cable for the iphone 5  and 5s and 5c  etc   is a nice little charger   one thing i like about is it that the plug portion is pretty compact so does not stick out very far at all from the the plug in the car   the green light is also not so bright so not as big a distraction as some others i've used   the cord is thick and feels durable   and it charges my phone   so that's a good thing 
came in cracked  seemed cheap  used it for a day or so  wouldn't buy again but it was only  0 99
received this case yesterday and so far  i am very satisfied   fit and finish is very good and the case doesn't add much bulk to the phone   there are a couple of rough spots on the edges but it really doesn't effect the case overall   would definitely recommend and will probably buy another in a different color just for a little variety   thanks  
my husband says it works great  the only issue he has is that he cannot leave his case on while it is in the craddle  although is says you can     it does not fit as snug as without a case  other than that he loves it 
i bought this for my mom because she has arthritis and has a hard time using her kindle fire  i guess i didn't read very well and didn't realize that i was getting all 10 colors  she loves these and how great they work  they're not the greatest looking but they get the job done 
when ordering this device  i expected that it was universal  i e  for all cell phone types  but as it happens it only works with iphones   it's not the product's fault that i don't own an iphone  but i would argue that the packaging should call it out in a larger font  pictures of iphones on the cover notwithstanding    to be fair  amazon's description does specifically indicate it is for iphones 
i absolutely love this case   fits perfectly with my samsung galaxy s4   the lip over the screen is great  so when you place the phone on a table  the screen won't get scratched   the rubber isn't too grippy  so when you pull it out of your pocket  it doesn't take your pocket with you   seriously  first off  if you hate your s4 battery cause it drains quick  get the anker 5200 extended battery   then    buy this   i go 2 days with moderate use on my battery 
to install this product you just remove the factory battery compartment cover from your phone and replace it with the replacement factory back that includes a flip cover  i carry my phone in the same pocket with my keys   asking for problems  i know  but this flip cover allows me to do that while protecting the screen from scratches 
not only is it a non slip cover it's also see thru and i like it  it's slim fit and just right  easy to remove and put back on  will buy again soon   
its a nice case but the rose picks up dirt  it does what it is suppose to overall  just wish i would have gotten another color 
let's get something out of the way first i looked at this and a couple reviews and was going to pass  i am not really impressed when i have to download an app for something i buy      i read a couple reviews that didn't really make it sound like something that would work for me   i was reading one where they guy actually took the time to update his review after giving it a pretty scathing rundown  i saw where ibolt answered back  nicely  on his review and addressed all his concerns and their changes   etc  etc  so i decided i could probably get my money back easily if it turned out i bought a lemon not the case i do have to tell you that i have a full size chevy truck and a windshield mount puts my phone too far away to be safely and comfortably used  i took parts of a ram mount and customized the mount and directly screwed it to my dash  not something i recommend or would do with a newer truck  but it was really my only option unless i wanted to try and get about 10 inches of extension hanging off the glass  there was no other way to get the mount somewhere i can see and use my phone while i am driving  so i don't have to take my eyes off the road so i used the phone for two days without downloading the ibolt app thinking it was just another app that didn't really do much that my phone didn't already do  galaxy note 3  wrong i downloaded the app and it makes all the difference in using the mount  when you plug in the phone  i have mine set to autolock  you need to unlock the phone and then the app is already running  setup your favorite icons  6 shortcuts x 3 screens   i have power amp as my preferred music player and have the camera app set so i can snap some photos or video  like a dashcam  i do have to take exception with the claim of   34 highly accurate gps  34  as i think some of the settings either need to be user settable or explain how to get the   34 once per second refresh rate  34   i have come to a complete stop for 3 or four seconds and the gps reports i am moving and sometimes take 2 or 3 seconds to register movement once i start moving i didn't watch the video on how to relieve one of the springs  after another day of putting my  case free  right now   phone in and feeling it was too much pressure  i took the mount down  looked at the back and front  and figured out how to release the cord  remove the phone holder part  remove the 4 screws  disconnect one of the springs and reassemble it all in about 6 minutes start to finish  nice  bottom line best phone mount i have ever bought  and i have bought many that didn't work out of the box or after hours of   34 modifications  34   this is the phone mount everyone should get  i am waiting for a slim case for my phone but have no worries that it will work great in the holder the bottom  feet  adjust for the thickness of the phone  phone in case   the spring loaded vertical clamp is nice and the fact that you can disengage one to minimize pressure on wider phones is great  all of the contact points have gripping rubber that is both gentle on your device but also keeps it from slipping around changes  not cons  it would be nice if the lower feet were adjustable so that you could move them inwards to make it a little easier  for the galaxy note 3 anyway  to hit the  menu  button  the phone needs to sit off sided to the right so the left  foot  doesn't press on the volume button  adding a mounting plate you can attach to the face of the dash somehow  like the  really  old mount plates for in car handsets  would be great  even for a small additional charge  there are just way too many different vehicles out there to take into account every possible mounting option  and personal seating position  to accommodate everyone but the  ball  size could match the popular ram mounts i did hear some buzzing a couple of times i plugged in the cable but it disappeared once i unlocked the phone and started the music    haven't noticed it again in the last few days  never bothered to contact ibolt directly as the one youtube video on the app and my natural mechanical ability has made me a happy user if anyone is interested in my custom mount solution i can tell you i cut the   34 ball  34  off of the ibolt mount  drilled it to accept the standard camera mount thread size  3 16 i think   i then took a surface mount ram mount with camera ball and screwed it into the ibolt ball  so it basically is a large ball  ram  attached to a smaller ball  ibolt   the ram base used two screws i fastened into the front edge of my dash right above the gear shift lever  in park   it is very solid so i don't get dizzy looking at a bouncing screen kudos the the ibolt guy who made the good response to the negative review  and the guy who took the time to update his review after getting his issue resolved  with out those two components  i would have passed on a very good product thanks
they put all their effort into creating a phone  without a mouthpiece  and added a really cheap headset onto it  if you want a lot of dialing features to carry around the house with you  caller id  auto dialing  etc  then the phone part of this is okay  my portable phones all do these things  and are only a bit heavier   but i wanted really good sound  and this doesn't have it  it has one of those mikes that doesn't make it all the way to your mouth  and the  volume control  is in the phone with only 3 levels   not enough to help i followed another reviewer's idea and called into my voicemail from this phone  and from several others in the same call  then i listened on different phones  this one is slightly better than the  20 headset i was trying to replace  but worlds worse than just talking into a regular phone  not worth  100 
i would have liked it but it leaves the top and bottom exposed  easy to get nicked  i strongly suggest they fix that 
this is more for fashion than protection  if you are looking for a cute accessory for the phone this is great  if you want protection this is not for you  i like it a lot 
this is a very convenient and elegant case for nexus 5 smartphones  it's quality made  with soft synthetic pu leather exterior  and soft felt interior  the case fits nexus 5 very snugly and securely  the case leaves all of the phone's ports and buttons accessible even while it's closed  the case feels protective enough of your phone  although i would still not trust it with the more drastic falls from high ground  the case doubles as a kickstand for your phone  a very nice and convenient feature  as we consume more and more of content on our phones it becomes increasingly important to be able to use these devices in a manner most convenient for media consumption  and this case provides exactly that 
good quality item that works very well with my iphone 5  ipod and blackberry  and saves having to carry around separate cables 
this case would've been rated higher had it been treated since it's flexible plastic   after only a few weeks  it started turning yellow from the edges and it's working it's way in toward the center of the case   i own a white iphone and this looks unsightly   it looks like the yellow stain from an ashtray to be exact   it's unfortunate since this fit my phone perfectly and i have no complaints otherwise   overall  if it doesn't bother you that it will turn yellow  then this case is okay 
rating is definitely a 5 for both design and usefulness  my only regret is that it lacks an ink pen option  this is the most responsive stylus i have used to date  i like that the tip retracts to be protected from damage in the pocket  the tip is so much more precise than a finger tip  and easier to control  i used the stylus on my ipad retinal display and on my samsung s4active with equally satisfying results 
horrible  if i could give this zero stars i would  the screen gets in the way  looks like its glues on with hot glue  the case is horrible  the holes for the usb volume camera do not line up  as a matter of fact i had to take it out of the case to take pictures which was almost impossible because the case was difficult to take apart  i wish i never spent money on this definitely a waste 
i've got quite a few cell phones and am always looking for good accessories for them  so when zeetron offered me one of their batteries for review  i was happy to accept the offer the battery fits perfectly in my galaxy s4 and works as good as or better than the factory samsung battery  the factory battery is a 2600 mah battery  and the zeetron claims to be 3200 mah  which should offer 10  more battery life  i say that zeetron  claims  3200 mah because despite what many people believe  the only way to know the capacity for sure it to test the battery with a proper tester  which i do not own as they are very expensive   any other means of assessing a battery's capacity amounts to little more than guesswork    even when using a tester app on your phone  you are not necessarily getting a true picture of the capacity my best guess is that the zeetron battery does indeed have more capacity than the oem battery  because the phone does seem to last bit longer  at absolute minimum  the battery is as good as oem  taking the performance and price at time of review   14 99 for the s4 model   this battery is clearly a five star product and i would happily purchase more if i need another battery 
ok before i get started i just want to say that the phone is great and so far it makes a great paper weight   update now working with net10 perfectly  i have had plenty of time to fiddle with all the settings and because of wifi i have been able to update all my apps and make the phone the way i like it also if you have not read any of the reviews and your used to the un touched android system you should know that at t  added and changed some of the things in the pantech like the bottom four soft key buttons can't be changed  call mess net etc    i found a way around this using  go launcher pro  from google play   it is a free desktop skin for android and it overrides the at t  screen and has a bunch of great themes you can add to it  very sweet   also their call program is a bit different  but in the end i ended up liking it better than the original as it was easier to navigate and the colors are easy on the eyes   update on the call program  i found that i could not use the at t  contact list as it would just hang waiting to talk to at t  servers   since i was not going to use this phone with at t  i found another great freebee on google play called  ex dialer   not only did it by pass the at t  program so that i could use my contacts updated from my google account  it also has some great skins to make it cool looking it still takes me a little bit to get used to having the settings and home buttons as  hard  buttons instead of  soft touch  buttons but it's not that big of a deal   i heard of some folks talk about the screen being hard to see or have a yellow tint but my phone shows none of those problems and the screen can be set to be very bright   it does not have an auto brightness built in like my droid   i bought a nice rubberized case for it that fit it perfectly and ordered some screen covers to boot the camera for me takes pretty good pictures even in lower light but one draw back it that it has about a 2 second delay from when you hit the camera button and when it clicks the pic   you almost think it isn't going to take the picture so if your trying to get that quick before it's gone pic you might be disappointed  but i didn't need a super camera so it does just fine for me the outside speaker on this phone is very quiet compared to my droid   i could hardly hear the ringer even if it was in my hand and i found myself wanting to keep turning it up   so to fix this i found another app on google play called  funny sms ringtones  and it has some great  loud   funny  sounds for notification and ringtones that are easy to hear   i think that it's not so much the speakers fault but that the built in ringtones are just to quiet   so now when my phone rings  testing it  it is very loud    update   after using this phone in the real world with the new ringtones i have no problem hearing my phone even in it's case now the real reason i bought this phone over many others was because of the keyboard   most keyboards are too small for my big  meat cutter fingers  to use   but pantech decided to use four rows instead of 5 so that you can actually get your fingers on the darn buttons   some complain about that and others say it's great    update  i did notice that when using the screen keyboard that it does not have a t9 or any other suggestion program like my droid had but since i use the keyboard most of the time anyway it does not matter to me except when i can't spell something right     other than that it does what most android smart phones do and i really like the phone and it's  different  design and should be happy with it for some time so now the ugly     if you are thinking of buying this phone and using it with at t  just don't do it   you will regret it and will be very upset for spending your hard earned dollars   if you want a taste of how bad things are with at t  just google          and read all the reviews i myself bought this phone to use with net10 and i'm just waiting for the sim card and minutes to arrive in the mail   but i was hoping to use the  25 air time to hold me until my stuff came from net10   well after several frustrating talks with amazon that kept trying to get me to the amazon wireless  who by the way has nothing to do with prepaid phones  i finally got to talk to someone who took the time to forward me to at t  and wait on the line until i got to talk to a real human  almost impossible to do with at t   after talking to the at t  rep i found out that it could take up to 10 days to activate my phone   i said what     ten days  are you kidding me   he said yes   i told him that there isn't another phone company anywhere that would make me wait 10 days to turn on a phone   he informed me that there was nothing he could do as it was already in the system  in the mean time my phone keeps getting texts  every day  from at t  telling me i need to give them more money   and i asked him about that   he said my information was in the system and it  should  activate   but yet the stupid system keeps telling me to give more money  even today    it does not say anything about my phone waiting to activate   they have very deceptive practices and very lousy customer support from india the other thing they don't tell you is that even if you buy a  50  unlimited  card you still have to pay for a  data  plan for this phone   the  unlimited  plan does not include your data  and you have to have a data plan for this phone    so in the end you will end up paying the  50 00 and up to  15 00 for a data plan   for a better price you can use this phone with a company like straight talk or net10 for  50 bucks or under and it covers everything   so save yourself the trouble and don't use at t    it has been over 6 days now  update 9 days  and still i get the  give us money texts  and no service from them   even though they say everything is right and i did set it up correctly   i did finally get amazon to give my  25 bucks back and that helped with all the trouble so in the end after spending months looking for a good smart phone from some of the pre paid company's and being very disappointed with the quality as most were very cheap this phone feels great and the keyboard is supper easy to use and has a nice feel to it  especially with the new rubberized case    i would not have a problem paying the full price for it   though i just saw that it went up almost 40 bucks  update  looks like they dropped it back down   still when looking for a great quality though not the fanciest smart phone this phone is very much worth the price   just don't think you will get that  25 bucks from at t  because you will be sadly mistaken   i have talked to amazon about this as i'm sure others have too but it seems that because it is sold with the credit it is not something they can change so make a informed decision and get a good phone and ignore the  25 dollar air time credit update 9 10 12  ok so after 9 days i still had no service from at t  and my net10 sim and air time card finally arrived   so i called up net10 to make sure i did everything right   took about 5 minutes to ad my information and activate the sim   told me to turn off the phone and turn it back on   so i did and like a normal phone service should act my phone was activated and running in less than 10 minutes after that i had to update the access point name on my pantech to work with net10 data servers  internet and email  and i was done   they give you pretty easy instructions on the settings that need to be updated but i still had to go online to see where i could find these settings on my phone for those of you that are not intimidated by this  this is how you do that   on your home screen hit the settings button  left hard button  and touch the settings tab   then touch the  wireless   networks  button   then scroll down to the bottom and touch the  mobile networks  button   the you will see the third listing down is  access point names  so touch that button   when you get to this point you will see the two at t  settings   so now just click on the left hard button to bring up the settings and touch the  new apn  button   from this point you will need the settings that come with your service provider   just fill in the ones it tells you and leave the others blank   make sure to take your time and get all the spelling right or you will have to do it again   after that  just hit the back button and then you will see the new apn  net10  straight talk    just touch the button next to the name to highlight it green and then click your home button and that's it i do thank someone for telling me about going to facebook to fix the at t  problem but if that is the way a company works where i can't talk to someone live on the phone and fix the problem then i do not want to do business with them   i know for a fact that there is no way to prove who you are on facebook and you could be talking to anybody in the world   there are millions of fake facebook accounts   if you gave that person your information and then found out it was fake you would be in serious trouble   it's just not the way to do business one more thing that i thought i would mention is about the google sign in when you first boot up the phone   if you have ever had a android phone before and had a google account then this is the account you want to use when it asks   if you don't have one then you will at this point want to go online and make one as you will need it to get on the google play for all your apps   even if you have not activated the phone you want to enter this information the first time you turn on your phone because if you don't do it now there is a chance that it will never sync your accounts  email and personals like phone  's    and then the only way to fix it is to factory reset the phone and start over   just ask me how i found this one out lol    so in the end what is my view on this phone   i really like this phone and if it had been my first android phone i probably wouldn't have known the difference   i think in the end it would have been better for at t  to leave the phone alone and let the customer decide what programs they wanted or at least make it possible to remove them   but thankfully by using a couple of add on's like go launcher pro  ex dialer   funny sms ringtones it made my phone work like a charm   i also understand that this is not a high end phone but in the end it was way better than the stock phones i saw in the stores for  100 bucks or more and i am very pleased with it   so if your going to use at t   not my suggestion  then you probably would be able to use this thing right out of the box  once they finally get your phone turned on    but if your going to use it with another company then i would download the few add on's and make sure your google account is entered as soon as you first turn on your phone and you should be pretty happy with it   i know i am so thanks for taking the time to read my very long review and good luck    update 9 9 13   well if you made it this far on my super long review then you will be super glad to know that after a year i have had not one problem with this phone   it's still going strong with no key problems or any other problems   really this is one of the best phones i have ever had   now i have a friend that uses verizon and has gone through more phones than i have underwear  no kidding    every time he tells me he had to get another phone because of this or that i just laugh and shake my head and thank god that after a year i am still going strong with this little phone   the only thing i have had to buy is another case as i finally dropped the phone and it broke   but then that is what cases are for    
received right earlier than expected and this pen is great especially with the extra stylus cover that is so smooth   in addition the weight of the pen is perfect  and it came in a nice gift box 
the least you need to know  the jabra motion uc is good enough  though not stellar  at what it does  with a few annoyances sprinkled into the mix i was quite excited to get this headset  not only will it be a major convenience not having to hold my rather large galaxy note 2 'phablet' against my head  it ought to promote safety when i'm driving  too  unfortunately there were a few hurdles to jump  starting with its design  if you have the ears of a say  barack obama  this should fit you quite well  for me with what i think are average ears  it's a devil of a thing to put it on  i have tried all the combinations of plastic ear inset and lengthening shortening the post  nothing seems to make it fit snugly on my ear although i do have to say that it has not fallen off the ear  it just doesn't feel secure  if you wear glasses or sunglasses  it makes it feel even more precarious the jabra works quite well although i also did run into a few problems there too  i have not had any issues with volume  it comes through clearly  those i've talked to have no problems hearing me which tells me the mic is just great  i also like how the volume controls on the back of the jabra operate by touch control  that's a nice touch  no pun intended  setting up the device to pair with my galaxy note 2 was easy as well although i did have to take off the protective case on the note 2 to be able to use the 'touch'  i had no problems using the included usb dongle to connect the headset to my pc  all easy  the software management suite  jabra control center  on both the galaxy note 2 and the pc was a breeze to set up and gives information about the headset as well as the ability to manage the device including upgrading software interestingly  it is possible to use the headset with softphones  voice over ip  and others  we use the cisco jabber at work  but no matter what i did  i could not use the headset with it  skype works  but as of december 2013  it will stop working with it  ah well my major problem was with voice command  a call comes through and i have to positively scream  answer   before it picks up  i've lost a few calls this way before i started ensuring the phone was nearby so i could manually pick up  in addition  the range of commands available is stunted  you put the mic in command mode by clicking a tiny button on the underside of the extended boom  but there's only so many things you can say  this could be a problem of interface between the note 2 and headset but i couldn't be bothered to figure it out at this point i simply have to take two stars from an otherwise good product  for the commands issue and the precarious sit of the headset on the ear 
these are legit  i used to get different ones but i found these and they are awesome  they don't scratch easily and cover the whole screen  take your time to put it on and it will look great 
samsung galaxy s 4g is my phone   it would not charge the phone   it would not even register that it was connected   finally looked compared the info on the new and old cords and the new didn't have the right nomenclature 
i tried an unnamed competitor's brand and had to return it   it was that bad  the seidio innocase on the other hand is perfect  fits great and does not add much bulk  i got 2  a black one for me and a purple one for my wife the small clasps on the top part of the unit snapped off the other day  i've had the case for about a year now and it is plastic so i guess you could expect this  i liked it so much though  i just ordered another one  the good news is that my wife's is still going strong 
not much to say  they clean off fingerprints and help your phone look like its new even with a protector on it 
perfect fit  is a bit small for the big screen but this phone has serves and protects and that's all
the pink color is really pretty  and it has little sparkles in it you can't see in the pic  got a screen protector with it that works fine  really good for price
amazon vine review i've been switching back and forth between plantronics backbeat and motorola s9 for a couple years now  but lately  i find that my backbeats don't fit as well as they used to  so i've been reaching for my s9 more and more  only problem is  i'm really not all that fond of the wraparound band on the s9 since it makes it impossible to rest your head back and listen to music  also  that band often hits the back of my wheelchair headrest and often pops off my head  so it's been on my mind that i may be in the market for a new stereo headset enter jabra sportthe first thing i noticed about these headphones is the wire connecting the left and right earbuds    it's very pliable and flexible  by contrast  the wire on my backbeats is much thicker and stiffer  and does not bend as freely as the wire on this jabra  the wire on this jabra sport is thin  pliable and much more comfortable to wear  be it during activity  or kicking back just to enjoy some tunes easier controlsanother plus for these jabras over the backbeats and s9  is that all the controls are located on the right earbud only  this is a huge improvement  to this day  i still find myself fumbling to remember which ear does what with my other 2 headsets  is left for volume and right for track skip  or is it the other way around  it gets especially confusing the more i switch between the backbeats and the s9  but thanks to the streamlined button layout on the jabra sport  that won't be an issue no huge glowing leds    yay it's a pet peeve of mine    i hate huge glowing leds that scream  look at me  i'm wearing a bluetooth headset   thankfully  jabra had the smarts to just put a small  understated led on this one  about the size of a pinhole  which is plenty big for a glowing led  i know this may not be a big plus to most people  but it is to me sound qualitythese sound really great to me  on par with my backbeats and s9  in fact  these jabras seem a bit richer in sound  they go pretty loud  but i always find myself wishing all my headsets could go 2 or 3 decibels louder than they do  either i'm going deaf  or i just like my music loud  but that seems to be an issue across the board for all the headsets i've tried  so i often boost my mp3s manually a few notches to hit the volume i like good fiti did have to play around with the 3 different sized ear gels to get the fit i want  but it didn't take long and these jabras actually fit me best over my other 2 headsets short charging cordthis seems to be a jabra thing  because i have a regular bluetooth headset of theirs too just for calls  and the cord on that charger is literally 3 inches  they've upped the ante on this one and given us a whopping 7 or 8 inches of cord  but still much too short  not sure why they're doing this  but it's definitely a running theme with jabra  the good news is  these use a standard micro usb charger  so i'll be using one of my better  long corded chargers with these built in fm radioi don't listen to the radio much anymore  but i really thought this was a neat feature and like knowing it's there  just don't expect tuning to be very easy because there's no display or preset channels  but it's still a nice touch simple paring    30 seconds topsgreat user manual    brief and to the point  with an excellent layout that enables you to read descriptions and turn pages while still having a numbered diagram of the headset visible  perfect bluetooth signali'm convinced that environmental variables  and device capability play a huge factor in different user's experiences with bluetooth connection  some cell phones are better than others  and some environments more problematic than others  for me  the bluetooth connection on these jabras is on par with all my other headsets  yes  i get the occasional dropout  but no better or worse than any other headset i own  imo  there's nothing more reliable  or rock solid  than an actual wired connection  no matter if it's bluetooth headsets  wireless speakers  wireless hdmi  or cordless phones  just my opinion terrible packaging    be prepared to burn some calories just getting this headset unboxed  terrible  definitely not frustration free call quality    is decent  no better or worse than any of my other headsets connect to 2 devices at the same time    huge bonus  mine is paired to my cell phone and my toshiba thrive tablet  yay bottom line    i really like this jabra sport and fully expect to use them as my new go to headset over my backbeats and s9  but i gotta dock 1 star for the terrible packaging and the ridiculously short charging cord  yes  it's that inconvenient  otherwise  these are pretty great and i like the look and feel 
i love that this case is large enought to fit over my ottercase   i work where i have to bend over and stoop down quite a bit  so i need to feel that my phone is secured 
the belkin shield sheer matte case   cover for apple iphone 5c  topaz  is thin and easy to snap on  an easy  low profile cover  if a simple cover is what your are looking for  this one is nice and a good value 
it broke too easily it wasn't that expensive after all  so i guess i shouldn't expect it to last that long anyway but it looked nice and the product description was accurate 
thank you the item was received it was 100  satisfied with the item the one that received it was very happy as well thanks
cheap  hard  and protecting  it covers the sides and back really well  it is made out of a hard plastic and it fits perfectly  nothing else to say about it 
five stars   love it  and a product has to be pretty great to qualify that statement  i'm so glad to see that someone gets it when it comes to building sturdy  attractive  and yet affordable cd slot mounted phone cradle  not only does it look great in my car  through several days of use  it has proved to be sturdy and easy to use  over bumps  the phone barely shakes at all  the only complaint i could come up with is the spring is pretty heavy on the clamp so its hard to get the phone mounted in a one hand operation  i can appreciate that the stiff spring is necessary to keep the phone secure so definitely a design limitation 
this is the exact same model i have for my iphone 5 and my brother bought a samsung galaxy s4 and wanted the same unit   the price was super low compared to what the att store wanted for a similar but bulkier unit   the retractable stand on the case itself and the external case belt clip can be propped open with a built in wire clip makes this a winning combination for being able to sand the unit portrait or landscape  freeing up the hands   a must have for the smartphone user 
after 2 weeks of roughly use i've read a lot of bad reviews of bluetooth headsets  especially with the sweat proof feature  and the distance needed beetwen the headset and the phone i've probed that this one  does exactly what his specs says distance  i put my phone on my pants pocket  and i listened for almost 4 hours  and it didn't disconected no even once water proof  i have to admit that i sweat like a pig  i won't deny it  and this little headphone worked perfectly after 2 hours of extreme running session  and even in with a drizzle  all the functions and buttoms worked perfectly listening time  it says 7 hours with full battery  and its 7  hours for real  after almost 3 hours of use  with full volume  the speaker said i still had left 5 hours of listening time weight and comfort  i really don't realize i had it on  until i touched my ears  most of the time for drying my sweat  very lightweight and comfortable and finally the sound is flawless  the bass explodes i'm very happy with this product  totally recomend it 
i  8217 ve owned and tested a lot of battery pack and have not always been as enamored with the digital display type as some other people  one of the problems i frequently encounter is a very heavy drop in power in the first fifteen minutes  yes  the oxa 10000mah did drop in power  but not appreciably so  after the expected drop  it continued to perform quite well  i don  8217 t run all kinds of tests  but rather run an informal one  i take a first generation ipad  usually with a somewhat depleted battery  to see how well it performs over time one very interesting feature is that on the digital display  which indicates the percentage of power left in the battery  also indicates which port you are using  for example  i  8217 m using the 5 0v 2 1a port  this is an important thing to know if you want an optimum speed charge for your device  for example  you won  8217 t need as much juice for your phone and may wish to use the other port  these are individually labeled  but a bit difficult to see in some lights a single tap on the button on the flat side above the oxa logo will light up the digital display  two quick taps will turn the small flashlight on or off  whichever you prefer  the light obviously won  8217 t light up a room  but will enable you to get around easily if the power goes out  there are four converters  but as a rule i prefer to use the cords that come with my own devices what it all boils down to is how well the oxa 10000mah performed  with 10000mah you can fully expect to charge up a tablet readily  provided it  8217 s not severely depleted  overall i was quite satisfied with the performance  something i really didn  8217 t expect  there are samsung digital cells and a premium chipset  which may have made a big difference  the only quibble i have is simply cosmetic  black is a print magnet and there was a slight bubble beneath my digital display cover  however  i  8217 m going to use it to charge my devices  not admire it start the ipad  15 the oxa 100 15 minutes  21   oxa 87  30 minutes  28   oxa 84  45 minutes  34   oxa 82  75 minutes  49   oxa 60  90 minutes  54   oxa 50  105 minutes  60   oxa 30  120 minutes  66   oxa 24  135 minutes  73   oxa 17  150 minutes  78   oxa 8  165 minutes  84   oxa 4  180 minutes  90   oxa 2  195 minutes  95   oxa 2  205 minutes  96   oxa 0  features   9658  samsung grade a cell and premium chipset ensure high quality  9658  above 500  recharge cycles over the life of the battery  9658  digital screen to display the battery status when charging  9658  2 usb ports allows to charge 2 devices at the same time  9658  built in led flashlight provides light when you need itspecs what  8217 s in the box   9658  power bank  9658  micro usb wire  9658  4 x phone converter  including 30 pin  9658  user manual  9658  travel pouchspecs   9658  model  oxa 10000  9658  cell type  li polymer battery  9658  capacity  10000mah  9658  input  5v 1 5a  9658  output  usb1  5v 1a  usb2  5v 2 1a  9658  size  4 1 8  8221  x 2 2 8  8221  x 7 8  8221   9658  net weight certifications ce fcc rohscompatibility apple iphone 5  4s  4  3  ipad 4  3  2  mini  ipods samsung galaxy s4  s3  s2  note 1  2  3  nexus  htc one  sensations g14 xe xl  evo  thunderbolt  incredible  droid dna  motorola atrix  droid  google nexus 4  nexus 7  nexus 10  lg optimus  ps vita  gopro  nokia n9 lumia 920 900   blackberry z10   sony xperia z  zte  t mobile  verizonsample provided for review 
i really wish i read the ratings before i bought this  it was very cheap  it took almost a month to deliver  when i took it out of the package i noticed right away  this is not what i intended to buy  instead  there is a sticker with slightly the same design but cut off in the back side of this piece of black plastic  the words are cut off  i wouldn't recommend this nor gift it to someone as a gift  you can keep my  2 00  this is going in the trash  i will post a picture if possible 
i love this charger  i like the 2 1a output and the look of it  it is sleek and looks great in my car  charges my ipad and phone very fast   no complaints 
while i liked the matte black version of this cover  this one was a bad color choice because within a week  it looked like it was holding evidence of its adventures  inside jeans pockets  dust color  air pollution in the city  etc 
case is professional looking  i love the fact that the flap flips down and doesn't block the back camera if i want to take a pic  lots of people have said that this looks like a  40  expensive case  thanks the price was cheap  but the quality is far from it 
i had always loved this phone  it provided the opportunity and do not hesitate  i am very happy with the nokia cell technology  are durable and easy to handle 
when i first received this as a sample for review  i thought    34 this looks so cool  i'll be able to see my phone on an angle as it charges   34  but that feature fell short for me  it is a rotating top but i found it hard to find the right angle to keep my phone charging but not sliding off  in all fairness  i have a samsung galaxy s4 so it is a large phone  but the rubbery surface was just not enough to keep it in place regardless of that  i could still charge my phone and it worked well  i did notice that my phone seemed to get a little warmer using this than other qi chargers but i'm not sure if that is the charger's fault or whatever i had running on my phone that day a nice unit with an odd 'twist' 
excellent pouch  it is big enough to fit my samsung galaxy siii with the battery backup case on the phone  this is exactly the product i have been looking for  i will buy another when my current one starts showing signs of wear and tear 
used this product with a google nexus 7  droid razr  powerline mobile ac outlet   dc to ac converter  ipod touch and thenew trent  nt120c carbonpak    12000mah  portable back up external battery charger power bank power pack for apple  ipad 4   3   2  ipad mini  iphone 5   4s   4  3gs  ipod touch  all version   samsung  galaxy note  s4   s3   s2  galaxy nexus   google  n   overall  the imp90c does exactly what it is supposed to do    rapidly charge phones and tablets  it fully charged my nexus 7 in about 2 5 hours and my droid in just a little over 2 hours  it even  very slowly  charges other devices not described in the description details  even though it slowly charges the  other  devices not listed  it is still better than it not being able to charge them at all pros  small   compact making it easy to take along with you hide away fold out prongsrapidly charges phones and tables as specified  even during hd graphic rpgameplay charges gadgets that aren't not described in the description details solid build of device and prongs cons  hard to keep the imp90c in the wall when some sockets are upside down easy to forget which usb port to plug which device in  ports need to be labeledoverall rating  5 stars   the device does exactly as described  it evencharges  other  devices not included in the description 
bought this for a friend     great price and fits her phone perfectly  she very happy and this phone cover is made just as great as the one you would but from a retailer but for only a fraction of the price   
started the day with a fully charged battery and the case fully charged at about 8am  when i went to bed around midnight the phone showed my battery at about 30   no charging done during the day  that's good compared to what i'm used to 
worked for what we needed it for  fits screen perfectly love the item will purchase additional ones if needed  thanks
got a new phone and dont use these any more  they worked fine when i was using them  get 'em if you need 'em 
exactly what i was looking for something simple and clear to show off my white s3  will buy another more my wife
this model  captivate  seems to have a software failure  it shuts down randombly  but most of all when battery level is under 40   i learned about it later  after having purchased it  astonished about the failure and having contacted samsung client service with no success  i googled the problem and there's even an application to prevent the shut down  captivate keep alive   but it runs down the battery life so quickly that it's practically unusable this item also sends some text messages whith     or other strange characters instead of the letters typed 
this was just what i was looking fori go through docking cables every 6 months because i charge my phone in my car using a power outlet under the center armrest  this crimps typical cables causing them to short out after a while this cable is flat and seems very durable  it inserts and comes out of the power outlet easily  it attaches firmly to my iphone even with a case  the length is just right for me  but may be a little short for some the usb port is potentially useful  but unfortunately for me it is on the automobile plug and isn't very accessible inside the center console the only disadvantage is the price  but i think it is worth it 
i'm honestly in love with this case  is so fluffy and perfect    i got it after 2 weeks from ordering it  was all put apart    the only bad thing is that you can't use the front camera but that's not big deal   i'm so proud of it and no doubt on buying it
this armband didn't turn out as i expected  when i tried it on  it was very tight and uncomfortable  the ipod fit pretty well in the case  and i was able to access the screen through the plastic fairly easily  however  i couldn't control the volume or lock the screen easy at all  it was difficult to press the buttons with the case through the case  quality wise  it is well made overall  but  with the issues i experienced  i would not recommend this particular armband 
i got what i expected and had no problems applying it to my itouch   now i don't have to worry so much when i'm slipping this in my pocket with other items  keys  change  to scratch it 
it protects the screen  yes  but it seems to attract dust and dirt and must be cleaned often  and the material the protector is made of gets scratched really easily  i guesss thats why it comes in packs of 5
battery look  works and performs like my oem battery   i have no reason to think this is a cheap knock off   price can't be beat either 
this product was delivered on time  and fit the screen just right  it was easy to apply  and is still in use  the pricing and delivery will be reminded  if i need to buy another for the same phone or smart phone 
works great  just the type of cord  i needed good heavy duty cord would recament it   will buy more in teh future
it is reliable   works well with the power adapter  but with all cables plugged in it tips easy   is far too bright for bedrooms  so for the actual function it is 5stars  but for other considerations it is about 2 5 stars  so  even though it is only usb2  not the faster 3  i give it 3 5 stars 
bad quality dont have transmision power in order to use in any radio i have tested this product with a lot of devices and is really bad i dont recomend this the other coments maybe fake 
great product  purchased for all my phones  works better and last longer than any other shield i have purchased in the past  plus it's a lot cheaper  if by chance there is a problem  their customer service is great too   warranty 
rating  4 5 starswhen outlets are limited  having enough charging slots for our excessive number of gadgets is very important  i only wished that newtrent made one with more charging slots   but much better than the traditional 1   the plastic feels reliable and high quality  and the flip to hide outlet fork is a very nice feature  coming in easy packaging  this piece is a nice and very reasonably priced replacement for the apple android kindle usb charging port adapters  the usb cord fits snugly into the adapter  and this product is very light 
bought this to replace my sisters phone battery  definitely a great product for the price  would definitely recommend it to anyone 
factory replacement battery  seems to work just as good as the original battery  no issues with fit  so far it is working fine 
works great   its sleek   and its cheap buy two or three and toss em where ever you may need them for me  clipping the phone to my shorts at the gym is the best way to go iphone 5 is light enough you don't need a big leather belt to keep your shorts up 
i just got my powerpak  and love it  i purchase it for charging my iphone 5 at work  they will not let me use outlets or usb on the computer to charge  so i got this to charge  since i listen to music all day  bingo  use it for 4 days 8 hours a day  and only used 1 bar to charge on four charge's  had to charge my phone every day  so that's four charges  and still only one bar used  i love the way it will shut off by itself  i also  use it with my long rides on my motorcycle  great way to charge and listen to music at the same time  thank you  would buy again
it fits  quality build  somewhat hard to get on and off  bought it for my wife  who didn't like the bulkiness  looks like it would have held up  price was right  shipped fast 
my son use and love it it practically cover your phone use for almost 24 h the price is great 
unless you work at a microprocessor plant and can do this in a clean room  don't waste your money  everytime i cleaned the screen of my phone with lens cleaner and the lens cloth provided with this product  a speck of lint from the cloth would get on the screen  i'd try to blow it off  but it would just stick to the screen  so i had to reclean the screen again  when it appeared that the screen was lint free  i tried applying the screen protector only to find that a piece of lint from the cloth found its way between the protector and the screen  at this point  it's too late because the lint is now embedded in the adhesive backing of the screen protector 
i where this headset at work  and i have been able to catch every call because it vibrates around my neck  i think this is a very good headset  and i will purchase another one as my backup 
does not live up to the hype  peeling off after a couple of days and had a crease across the middle  hope i can return it  i am pretty good at applying these and followed the directions exactly and the thing is still peeling off  i bought the skinomi tech skin for my wife's phone which is identical to mine and it looks great no peeling or bubbles and was  5 less 
i am highly pleased with this verizon prepaid phone   great phone for the price and service i receive  works really good in places where my other phones could not pick up service 
flo is unlocked and rooted  usb itg works outs of the box with no issues  my 750gb hard drive was recognised and the videos and pic play 
love this case it is perfect fit soft easy to take off an put on   would purchase again  but it does look a little like christmas  
smooth great feeling texture deep rich color hard case with rubber blended in will protect your phone if you drop it low price    has a nice tight fit 
i purchase cases for our companies fleet of iphones   i have tried many other types and brands of cases and was using the ifrogz brand before i found these   they fit the phone nicely  are just  sticky  enough to not fall out of your hand while using  and are perfect for sliding in and out of your pants pocket without binding   the holes on the back of the case allow for more heat to escape when using power hungry apps like navigation and streaming i typically order the black color and have really liked it  but decided to try the silver version this time   while over all the case is ok  the silver looks cheaper in quality than the black   the feel is the same  but the silver is slightly transparent and doesnt look as good on the black iphone   it looks more like a toy than a case the only overall design flaw  in my opinion  is the part of the case by the volume silent switch   the design leaves a thin strip of plastic along the edge closest to the screen   in a vast majority of phone cases coming back to me for replacement  this is where it cracks first   some people live with it for a while until it starts getting annoying by binding on clothes or snaps off completly all in all  i'd give it 4 stars because of the fit  design  and price  but i'm subtracting another star because of the silver color   this is our new standard in our office   just make sure you have a backup when the thin corner piece breaks  and it probably will 
the case is very simple and easy to install it fits perfectly and it feels like it protects my moto x better than my other more expensive case  i also appreciate the addition of a free screen protector  i will buy another case from this seller again 
great case  i bought it for my mom and she loves it  it is great protection color and loves really good on her phone 
displayed video from my device to 47  34  lcd  however the unit will not accept oem or third party chargers   turn off antenna  wi fi or any other battery sipping application and run on full charge   otherwise battery will drain 
in the picture this looks really elegant and pretty but when it arrived it was really tacky looking  the gems around the camera don't match the rest of the case and are really bold primary colors  also after using it for about a month the framing broke off of the mirror out of nowhere  it looked like it was just hotglued on
i had another pair of touchscreen gloves a while back  these are much better  the fact that the old pair only worked when touching the screen with certain finger tips on both hands was a pain  these gloves allow for you to use a touchscreen no matter what the finger  i find this nice especially since you don't have to make sure the contact on the finger is touching the screen well to activate the touchscreen these gloves keep you warm enough for a mild to colder day  if you are in temps below the 30's though you will probably want something more heavy  that will limit your ability to use your touchscreen phone although i hope that if it's that cold out you aren't worried about using your phone the whole time these were originally purchased to be a gift for my grandfather  he has long fingers like me so i figured that buying the xl size would be sufficient  it turns out that they were even tight on my hands and mine are smaller than his  i knew that these wouldn't fit him so i kept them for myself overall a good product  if you experience some colder weather and want to use your phone while you're outside these will get the job done great  much better than other touchscreen gloves as mentioned above  be weary of what size you order because they seem to run small 
love my new cases  it fits perfect and does not make my phone bulky  i can will slide it into my back pocket if i need to  i have dropped my phone and so far it has protected it  i bought a red polkadot  and black polkadot  love them  
great headphone cable management  don't have tangled wires in my pocket now  the clip is nice so it can be hung 
the unu usb car charger has three usb ports  1 amp  2 amps  and 2 1 amps   yes  i've used them to charge three devices at the same time  a dash cam  a power bank  and an iphone  and it works like a champ   the best thing about it is there's always a usb port available when i need it  and there is a plenty of power this charger makes no effort to blend in with its surroundings or sit flush with the panel   in fact  it juts out like a sore thumb  but it won't be easily lost   i don't even have to look to find it the only drawback are the ports are close together   if the usb plugs are standard size  all three will fit  but i have one usb plug that's a bit on the thick side   sticking it in the middle port means the port on one side is obstructed   still  most of my usb car chargers have only two ports at best  so i'm happy to have three   it's so handy to have in my car this product was provided for review by unu electronics 
meaning   i like the gell but not the hard cover that goes over it  it's too hard to ger over the phone 
these are okay however there appear to be a delay inresponse when talking even fully charge  the ear clipis very flimsy and broke after a weeks time 
great hybrid case to go with my newly deliver today nexus 5  adds no weight to the device and gives it a soft protection to absorb shock from drops  the different color borders around the edge is a nice touch  be cautious because since it is such a tight fit the tpu can make the screen protector you put on come up at the corners 
i bought these on a whim and it was a great idea  i've been handing them out to family and friends and everyone loves them  i tried each wire on my phone to test them and they all worked great and charged fast as well  they seem very durable  my wife goes through the rubber wires weekly and 1 of these has lasted her a while now  1 of the wires had an issue staying connected on her phone but worked great on mine  i am sure it is a problem with her phone since she breaks charging wires all the time wife liked these so much she asked me to buy more 
the quality of this case is comparable to the quality of an otter box  i drop my phone all the time  and as soon as i got my new htc one m7  i figured i should get a durable phone case to protect my phone from damage  i paid less than  5 00 for this  and  let me tell you  it surely does serve its purpose  since i have had this case on my phone  i must have dropped it about 15 times  even after dropping it all those times  there is absolutely no damage done to my phone  definitely worth the money spent  i love the design as well and how it comes in multiple colors 
this protectors is good   i like it and still very well without any problem   i like it   people should buy it 
these worked for a few months and went dead  i liked them while they worked  i wish they lasted longer tho 
 this case is extremely hard to get on and off your phone  it is very hard to press the mute button the space for the charger at the bottom only really fits apple products  it doesn't connect to the charger receiver in my car whatsoever offers great phone protection extremely awesome to not have to bring my wallet everywhere  now i just load the back on my phone with an id  credit card and business card    its great but the bottom is very frustrating for any other non apple power sources  
update 8 11 2013i've updated my rating from 3 to 4 stars based on diztronic's reply to my review   my primary concern was a possibility of receiving a used product   clay's explanation of the blemish by the usb port area convinced me that the case i received was new   the finish could still be improved however  small blemish aside  the case is beautiful and very comfortable to hold  fits perfectly  and very slim   i'd recommend it to anyone looking for a slim case that would still offer some protection to your phone original review i ordered my case through diztronnic's ebay store   the case was shipped promptly but i'm not happy with the case's finish   i ordered a matte back charcoal gray flexible tpu case for a galaxy s4 active   the case has worn out area right by the charging port where one would normally use a fingernail to open the rubber gasket   not sure if it's a manufacturing defect but it looks like the rubber coating is worn out from use   the case itself is super slim and doesn't affect the size of the s4 active too much but the product's finish could be better   either that or they sent me a used case the case fits well  feels nice and actually looks nice on the s4  hence  the 3 star rating   but from issue i mentioned above  i'm not too confident it will last too long   for the price  it's not worth the time to return for an exchange or refund   but i'm not sure i would be buying another product from diztronic 
i wanted a good protector for moderate day to day use  this protector 'looks' scratched and even bubbled due to pin size holes within a week  i have had other vendor protectors that stood up much better than these  i went thru 3 in one month and i am not  hard on my phone at all 
i bought it  because i thought it was very nice looking and it would be good for me to use in the office  as it looks more professional but i have to say  it's very heavy  it's seems like you are carrying 2 ipads   i didn't return it  because the price was too low and amazon charges you around    8 00 for to return  so it was not worthy to return and loose the money 
the only problem is    the paper leaves a glue film on the plastic that's hard to get off upon stabilizing the plastic on the phone 
everyone that sees my phone says    34 wow that phone is huge   34   some with a negative connotation  iphone users  and others wish they had this screen size   i'm 6'5  34  with big hands and this phone is perfect for me with that being said  even i was worried that it would be too big but even if i didn't have as big of hands as i do  i would still recommend this phone to anyone and everyone plenty of power  great looking screen  but best of all if the s pen functionality   it works sooo well and i use it all the time to take quick notes i would recommend rooting it and adding even more features   fantastic phone  5 stars
i received this device in exchange for a review i have now received four external battery devices from different companies with the agreement that i give them feedback on their product  of the four  i am the least enthused over this 5 star america charger  a few positives first  the device is very attractive  thin  small  and resembles an ipod touch  at  13 99 the price is definitely affordable  it works  albeit slowly overall  i am not very impressed  the 5 star america name with an american flag logo would imply that it is an american company  and that the device made in america  not only is this device made in china  but packaging includes a document that appears to be chinese  furthermore  a google search cannot find this company and the website listed on the back of the unit does not appear to exist functionally it works okay  i charged my phone from 48  to 100  in about 2 hrs  i let it run down again to 50  and charged to only 91  before the unit itself ran out of juice  at 3100mah  it should be good for a few charges  the device also boasts of a 2a output  which should charge an ipad   my other devices with these specs charge my ipad very well   this unit will not charge my ipad at all  the ipad does not go down in charge  but does not rise  now the company has removed it  8217 s claim that it will charge an ipad  but i highly suspect that the 2 1a output with 3100mah to be false so in summery  this device will charge an ipod or a smart phone  but speed tests between my other chargers leave this device in the dust  again  at 13 99  i guess you get what you pay for  but for my needs  camping  overseas travel  and remote areas with limited access to power  i wouldn  8217 t mind spending a bit more for a quality charger that will be good for more than one reserve boost 
simply great  durable  easy to use  works in all situations   i've used them for years and will continue to do so 
cheap plastic tabs  ears  broke the moment i stretched it a bit to insert my iphone   pure junk    don't buy it    
loved the watch originally  but then the battery stopped lasting   today  i unplugged at 8am   watch died at 4 pm   this has been happening for the past two weeks   i uninstalled all apps except gmail  texting app  and facebook app  thinking something was draining it   however  this had no effect i love being connected to texts  emails  and fb notifications  however   may get pebble 
i'm telling you someday your going to need this kit  it a great time saver and it's hassle free for swapping cell contacts 
amazing color and materialbut easy to scratchanyway u need to focus to see scratchesi bought 5 colors for my iphone 5sthey r amazing
it comes with 5 screen protectors  which is perfect if you are like me and it takes at least 3 to 4 tries before you can get it on just right with no annoying bubbles when i purchased my phone  i bought a  25 life time guaranteed screen protector for it and even had it applied to the phone in the store that i purchased the product from so it would be put on correctly  unfortunately  when it was put on  there was a piece of lint under the screen that caused a small bubble to appear on the phone and would not go away  this drove me crazy  and when i tried to fix this it completely ruined the screen protector and i had to get a new one because not getting the screen protector on just right the first time is not covered under the lifetime guarantee    long story short  i will never purchase one of those again for the price i paid and the amount of protectors i got  i really feel that this was a great deal for me  i am very happy with this product 
this battery appears to be oem and functions like the oem battery functioned  i have no complaint thus far  it arrived quickly   less than 24 hours  prime can be amazing at times 
fit my friends ipad original generation perfectly and she loved it   i got it in time for our gift exchange at work 
love the color its great in protecting my phone from falls and whatnot  would recommend to other people  need to collect all colors 
not what i expected at all   broke within 10 minutes of it being on the phone  which means just shoody craftsmanship 
works really well  i use it all the time  i can easily charge my nexus phone several times with it  the only problem is that it takes a very long to charge this unit 
a compact  solid powerbank with a hard plastic shell this battery bank is compact for its large capacity  holding enough juice to charge most smartphones 3 4x  as expected for that capacity  it weighs a bit more than smaller devices there are four led indicators to show charge level  a round on off button  and a small integrated led flashlight  both full sized usb outlets can charge a device simultaneously  after charging two bluetooth speakers and topping off my nexus5  the powerbank still indicated 4 leds of power  charge speed was respectable  similar to wall wart ac adapters the power button was kind of stiff at first  but seems to be working better with use  the powerbank leds light up automatically when a load is attached  and turn off automatically when charging is completethe packaging and instructional insert are kind of generic  but operation is so simple that the lack of detailed directions doesn't matter  a short cable is provided  with four adapter ends  including miniusb and microusb   similar to other oxa products i've seen  this powerbank also includes a textured cloth carry bag considering how important mobile devices are to modern living  i really like having this kind of powerbank in every bag i use  laptop case  camera bag  airline carry on  etc   this kind of unit fills the  in transit  gap  such as when i'm traveling and haven't gotten to the rental car or hotel yet  but really need my nearly drained smartphone battery to keep working   a sample was provided to me for review   this is a powerful unit with enough juice to service several devices  it's a bit heavier than i'd carry in a purse or camera bag  so this one goes in my laptop case  recommended 
worked great for a couple weeks  then started peeling at the edges   installed in a professional paint booth so i can pretty much be confident there was little to no dust particles trapped inside   had these on 2 different phones and they both started peeling   never used alcohol to clean either   editi may have put the protectors on less than perfect  which is why the peeling occurred  you have to be precise for the installation due to the nature of the note 2's curved gorilla glass   tech armor's customer service is top notch when handling returns and complaints alike   hats off to this company  they have one new customer for life and probably a handful more when i order these for the rest of my family's smartphones as well  
i like this protector  quality is good you will get 3 protectors  no bubbles ifproperly installed and comes with some installation materials like lint squeegee sticker for dust removal and installation guide  recommend this product
anker is a fine product though i'd never heard of it  the 2600ma  milliamp battery is solidly constructed  and while slim and easily slipped into pant's jean pocket  has a weighty substantive feel  it has a piano finish  high gloss shell  really nice   the charger boasts a micro port for charging ease  and comes  this is best part with a micro tip charger nestled smartly in the side of devices  attached to 2 3 inch coiled wire  just long enough to get your charge on this charger will give my motorola razr phone an almost complete re charging  by the time it's done this  your charger is dead  but  not bad  mission accomplished  for those interested in better understanding  my razr phone has a 2600 ma battery  so charger at 2600ma  phone holds 2600ma  being so happy with the anker product  i passed on buying thier 5600ma product  the 5600 would nicely recharge your phone twice with little trouble  and went for the insurance of the   upgraded version  anker astro2 dual usb output 8400mah backup external battery pack charger with built in flashlight   also purchased on amazon  this puppy should allow me to charge my smart phone several times a day with plenty of back up for another day  perhaps more  i'll never run out   smile  your tablet android ios  should be a cinch for the 8400ma device as well the 8400ma is slim as well  a bit thicker  not by much  still fine in trouser jeans pocket  so no worry there  anker has sent e mail after each purchase asking for feedback and general thoughts  they seem genuinely concerned with the reputation they hold in the marketplace  always a good sign highly recommended 
love the colors   fits the phone nicely  wonderful value  would recommend to a friend   does fit oddly with a screen protector  though 
this is a great product for trimming sim cards to a smaller size   the price was great  i could recommend this product to anyone   it is durable also 
these styluses work just as expected on my various tablets and smartphones  i chose these over any other simply because of the color options  quantity  and price these are just plain styluses  they are not ink pen   stylus combos it's convenient that they each have their own little clips for easy storage as well as holes at the top to run a string through etc they work great on my nexus 7  htc droid dna  acer a500  samsung galaxytab 10 1  lg lucid  galaxy nexus  motorola droid bionic and kindle fire perfect for use with apps like draw something  markers  and magic fluids and with the various colors  everyone in the family can pick one to match their case or style 
i just ordered another set of these covers because i wear them out when i place my phone in my pocket together with my keys  the keys scratch the cover or make small pin holes on the protector  but the cover is very durable  to install  clean your screen very well  place your phone on a dry towel on a flat  well lit surface such as table or desk   for best results  take a small amount of dish washing soap and mix it with water  just a dab but enough to make it slippery  take a small towel or wash cloth   dip it in the soap   water mix   wipe it on the screen so that it is wet  but not puddled or soaked  you don't want so much that it seeps into the phone   damages the electronics  but a light amount is ok  place the screen protector on the phone   align it perfectly along the edges of the screen and use a credit card   the edge of the credit card to squeeze the water   air bubbles out  use a dry towel to soak up all the excess water as it seeps out the sides  leave under a warm lamp to allow the clear plastic cover to dry   when it is all dry  it will be difficult to tell you even have a protective cover on your phone screen  best to do it at night so you can let it dry over night  let dry preferably under a warm lamp to speed up drying  note  the cover will still move while still wet  when it dries  it is like window tint  clear  on the screen with no bubbles and on the screen very well  i've done this many times to all my phones and for all my friends 
am really enjoying this usb car charger is compact it has given me the ability to charge devices simultaneously not disappointed on quality and value 
this is one of the most nice looking chargers i have found and at only  15 dollars it is a considerably good deal  there are many chargers around the price range of this  but what sets this apart from the others is that it is extremely small and compact  about the size of 2 quarters and the width of 1 quarter however  it does get hot  but i think that is normal with all chargers 
fits like a glove   nice design   nice sleek look   the i blason softgel tpu case provides good protection for your blackberry z10 without being too bulky   its form fitting design allows you to continue using the z10 without restrictions   other bulky cases impair the swiping action needed to use the z10    this   34 minimalist  34  design is perfect 
great sound  both the stereo and voice  and a good quality microphone makes this a great unit to use with a smartphone mp3 combination unit   voices come through clearly  people can hear me talk  and the music quality is good unlike some other reviewers  i didn't have a problem with the unit fitting into my ear i think that it is a matter of getting used to placing it correctly on the ear 
i wanted  protection for my phone and in baby pink    this does both  soft rubber shell protects my phone and i got the baby pink i was looking for 
these screen protectors are really great in my opinion  there ultra clear and don't smudge much  work great with my stylus and very easy to clean you get 3 in the pack and i'm still using the first one i put on a while ago  i would recommend these to anyone whoneed a affordable screen protector for their note 2
the energen 5600mah battery pack is a great sized battery to keep your smartphone powered all day box contents  energen 5600mah battery pack micro usb cable carrying case instruction manualthe battery pack has 5600mah lithium battery inside meaning that you can charge your devices around 2 3 times  the battery pack has 1 usb port  a micro usb port and an led flashlight  the usb port has an output of 2 1 amps 5 volts which is great for smartphones and tablets  the micro usb port is used for charging the battery pack and can be charged at 1 amp  5 volts  the led flashlight works fine but is not bright  it will work if you need to find something close by  i like this battery because it is small and also powerful  the size is perfect for a backpack  the battery pack is glossy black with some chrome on the side  the battery has a 4 led battery gauge  each led ring means 25  of the batteries capacity note  if you are looking for a battery pack for a tablet for 1 full charge  do not get this one because it has a low capacity of 5600mah which is only good for smartphones and other small non tablet devices this is a high quality battery pack and i recommend it i was supplied a sample for test and evaluation  and i promised that my review is fair and honest 
these as well as any other screen protector are a challenge to fit properly thankfully the price is rite and with a little practice you too can be a pro installer would recommend
this is a reliable device with my iphone  but i've had a few callers  maybe 1 in 10  complain that there is feedback when i use it   i never hear it  and can't tell what causes it   that is the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5   it charges very rapidly  holds the charge for a long time  over a week with  0  use   and can be used to listen to music or talk for up to five hours on a single charge 
i waited anxiously for otterbox to release this case and ordered mine within minutes of receiving the  defender released  e mail   i received the case on friday and i must admit  it did not disappoint first impressions   the case is of great quality and a lot of detail went into making it compatible with all the oem  accessories    the holster is among the best i've seen for a phone of this size and works perfectly with the case after carrying it for two days  and this is already my 3rd iphone 4 case   i am rough on my phones    the case is without a doubt the most durable i've seen for the iphone 4 and lives up to the reputation that otterbox has built over the years cons   the case does add considerable bulk to the phone and may not be perfect for pocket carriers   it does include a holster which works great and can rotate for vertical or parallel carrying of the phone miscellaneous   i have no complaints really  but i am left to wonder if the silicone  flaps  that cover the earphone and usb plug ins could have been a little more user friendly   sometimes they are frustrating to get back into their proper  closed  position edited one month after using   i am still extremely happy with the case   i have dropped my phones a few times already and though the case is starting to show signs the abuse i have provided it the phone still looks pristine   i opened up the case this morning to clean the phone etc and to my surprise there wasn't much to clean   with cases i've owned in the past i would have a forest of lint  dust etc  that would trap itself between the case and the phone   the otterbox has minimized that debris i am uploading several photos showing the difference between a  bare  iphone 4 and an iphone 4 in the defender case so everyone can get an idea of how much  protection  and in turn  bulk  this case adds to the phone edited to add   amazon removed my pictures when the placed the phone back in a  pre order  status  i will re upload them again once they allow   i'm not sure why they state  pre order  when it should state  back ordered  will deliver in xx to xx weeks   but i digress 
i got this on time and when i got it i put it right on my phone and boy you guys weren't joking when you said mirror effect  loved this screen protection 
these did not fit my phone as they were for another version of that phone for another company  but worked well for other things
these are great for the price but i have found after a month or two of nightly plugging and unplugging the same cable into and out of my gsiii that the little barbs that hold it in have flattened if i'm not careful  the cable comes out of the phone and it obviously won't charge   still  the cables work great  just be aware that you get what you pay for and the cheap on this cable is the barbs   although i'd rather have that than cables that won't work 
my boyfriend really loved his case  it was much cheaper than at the t mobile store and of a better quality 
i thought the majority would be right on this product  but i was wrong in this case   mine also came with no backing pressed between a cardboard cover and simply would not install 
typical otterbox quality  very slim and form fitting  i feel this case adds protection with minimal weight to the phone   my only complaint is that the rubber piece in front of the power button seems to have a small bump that pops up after use and it must be adjusted to keep a clean look 
great battery so far  great customer service  i'm extremely satisfied with this company laptop mate  they responded very quickly to a problem i had  even when it was my fault erin   sunnie were great in communicating with me by phone and e mail  i'll definitely buy for them again update  unplugged charger   4 30 am its 9 00 pm and i still got 25   normal use calls  texts facebooking   craig's list etc  very satisfied wirh this battery 
this fix perfectly to my phone  motorola moto g  and the services to the costumer   me      is incredible  they not only send the packed fast and carefully packed  also send a video link with properly instruction of how to put the screen protector to the phone  which is a plus for those who never have done this before  i am very satisfied whit this    sorry for my bad english  this is not my native language 
i don't know the technical specifications  but this usb to micro usb allows me to charge my kindle by plugging it into my computer or using an adapter to plug it into an outlet  but not my blackberry curve   when plugged into my computer  i can drag and drop files to my kindle  i havent tried it with my blackberry also  in case not all suppliers using this xescription are  in fact  supplying the same product  i dont know the rules for that   i got mine from media mart
i have an ipad 2 and an ipad mini   the mini i use primarily as my music player  to replace my ipod   i used this battery on both with about the same results   the ipad 2 was at 20  and i hooked up this battery  continued to surf  and play music   in three hours this battery was drained  and my ipad went up to 59    so this battery charged up my battery and continued to let me play music and surf the web for three hours  that works out to this battery giving me around an extra 5 hours of use without having to plug in the ipads   of course it takes about 20 hours to charge it back up  being a full time student i don't have many opportunities in my heavy class days to get a chance to plug in and charge my ipads  i don't know if i would charge anything with this battery inside a case  like a backpack or book bag  it does get hot while hooked up and charging the ipads   doesn't heat up too much while charging the battery itself   i have the mophie 4000 mah battery and it gives me about 2 hours extra use  it is enough to get me through the day if i am careful and don't do too much extra with it   this battery gives me way more time and use of my itoys  i haven't used it on my iphone at all  but  i have the mophie battery case for my 4s  and that gets me through my days beautifully all in all i love having this battery with me in my school bag   it is perfect security to never run out of juice 
use this in my 2013 prius and it works and looks great only problem i found is the adjuster on the bottom blocks some of the words on my screen of the head unit in the car
i haven't installed this yet because i haven't yet had the time  but i am anxious to as it looks like a great product 
i bought this product to gift it to my brother with samsung galaxy s iii  but this looks so cheap product  i will never recommend to buy this product 
i am giving this product 3 stars for its classy styling  it does not really work with ipod 2g  even my big fingers work much better 
i love this case   and i am not easy to please   i have hated every other case i have ever had with a burning passion   the commuter isn't too bulky like the defender and it isn't just silicone like some which are impossible to get out of a pocket without removing the case from the phone   i can still use the factory kickstand    and it comes with a screen protector   amazing  simply amazing   go buy one  now 
the wall plug was exactly what i needed since i carry two cell phones and it simplifies the charging process for me  it also comes with a warranty so that shows me that the company stands behind the product  i plan on using it everyday 
bought this on recommendation from steve harris's backup power tsp show where he discussed running a small and larger inverter off your car's battery during a power failure  i like that this has both a standard outlet plug as well as usb charging ports when it is running the fan inside turns on from time to time to keep it from overheating  we have used it in the car for various things when out and about  and it is just really convenient  i bought a second one for the other car  good quality for a good price 
it was very cheep  for 5 pieces i paid little under  2  but the thing is you it does not fit the phone properly   i had to use scissors to trim some portion of plastic  i guess that will do for now   also it is different from what is in the picture  so i'm surprised but its ok 
for the price i paid   it is ok  but the tip came off quite easily had to glue it back   i would recomend it   just be aware tip might come off   but again for the price you can not go wrong and it works ok  and yes i would buy it again
best buy for its price  it s better that i expected because of its high build quality and great performance  i had never tried any new trent product  but now i can say that they make me feel very confidence about their products  in terms of performance is just what i was looking for  this charges my smart phone very fast  almost twice faster than samsung stock charger  i would recommend this one to anybody looking for a fast way to charge their gadgets without spending lot of money 
the power supply works when it wants to work ok for phone  but lousy with a playbook stick to the folding blade charger for a true travel adapter charger 
works as it should  fingers easily slide across the screen and does not rub against it  will buy these again if needed 
i love it it always come in handy i dnt have to take a bag with me when i go out all i need is my wallet case
i bought this case for my fiance  she loved the vibrant color and the minimal protectin from scratches while retaining the iphone's slim design  unfortunately  the cases color faded on the corners with time 
this is a great case for the samsung galaxy s5  it is made of soft rubber and does a good job protecting my phone   the screen protector was awsome too 
having just purchased a new iphone 4s i figured i would need as much space as i could get to store my massive amount of data  i have over 40 gb's of music alone and only purchased the 32gb phone so juggling what i want to put on my phone along with applications and photos has been tricky  i love that this small device solves my storage issue by giving me remote access to it wherever i am as long as the device is charged up this is also incredibly useful for sharing data with others  i went to my friend's home and they were able to link up with this immediately with no issues and see my videos  very cool  that feature alone is worth the price  the ability to have a tool that gives friends remote access to files you want to share is amazing  it's super cool having this tiny little gadget in your pocket that acts as a little router  love how easy it works and it was also pretty darn fast  no lag on my friend's part i am taking one star off because i don't know how often i will tote this around in my pocket with me  i love that it makes sharing my stuff easier and that i can store additional music  photos and videos on it but i am not sure that i want to bring it everywhere i go  that said  it's pretty cool  i was very impressed with the ease of using this and how fast it worked 
good price  they work well with tablets and ipads and even on my phone  know if my kids loose one i have plenty more 
great price  great value  i will definitely buy more but the package already comes with 3   i would probably give 1 to my friend who also have samsung gs4 
works perfect for a replacement for the one my daughter lost   fits perfect in lifecase   recommend to any one with small kids  that like to lose things 
summary  stay away  this product sports a very poor design   pro   very low price  very small and lightweight  relatively easy to use  pair up well with all my bt phonescon   morse code like feedback signal   they try to accomplish too many tasks with single beep tone   1 short beep  2 short beeps  3 short beeps  1 long beep  3 beeps up  3 beeps down   like another reviewer said   you really have to read the manual or keep it nearyby to be able to understand what all the beeping means   echos no matter what volume you set it  partly because this thing is very loud  insanely difficult to open the battery door   i got so frustrated  i was about to throw this thing out of the window   for a product that use regular batteries  the battery door is the most difficult to open   once opened  you need a pair of tweazers to pull the battery out   the battery compartment is very deep and extremely snug   this must be a sick joke by motorola   forget about changing the battery on the go  you need to sit down and have a few tools and a lot of patience    for the record  this was my breaking point  i had to return this unit  because installing the battery for the first time was enough of a turn off   sound quality is mediocre at best
incharged it and it only added 6  more to my battery and after that it wouldn't charge my phone  the little blue lights disappear as fast as they appear when charged 
with the large number of power hungry devices that most of have now  finding a place to charge them all can be a problem  the bolse 5 port usb charger is a solution to your charging problems it comes with a 5 foot cable that is plenty long for you to place it where you need it  a small slit glows yellow on the front of the unit to let you know that it is ready to go  there is one port on the left and right sides  1a each  and three  2a  ports on the bottom  the manual says 2 are for ipad iphone and the last one is for samsung  they are universal  except the manual says the samsung port will not charge an ipad  which after testing found was accurate the white color will go well with your apple devices  there are rubber feet on the bottom that will help hold it in place if you are plugging in multiple devices  i like the fact that there are ports on three sides although your preferences may vary  this product does its job very well  thanks lowerpriceusa for providing me  this awesome wall charger review sample 
i bought this cable to charge my ipad on the nightstand  so that i'm not tethered to the one side of the bed while it's charging  it works well  some of the other longer cables i tried  isn't supported  by the ipad  but this one didn't cause any problems  i plan on ordering more for all the other apple devices in our household 
this was purchased for my wife  the product was shipped from hong kong  so it took almost a month to get here the product looked not as shiny as pictured here 
it's a great screen protector  i love the lime green color  the only flaw in it for me was the glittery surface   try to mention that in the description  
after trying other brands  took the plunge on the imagnet based on positive comments and ratings   attaches firmly to my textured vinyl dash  and the magnet grabs my galaxy note 2 with no movement while driving   i also really like the small height profile of the mount  minimizing field of view obstructions   this was close to a last resort  since my windshield rakes sharply  and a cd mount would obscure center controls or the nav screen   hoping this continues to perform flawlessly 
i loved this case and i got lots of compliments on it  it really is a great hard  soft case  easy to take on and off 
as a person of a certain age  i did not start using my thumbs to type on a pda or phone  i learned graffiti for the palm and used it for years  that means that i'm very comfortable using a pen for input  i have a hard time using my thumbs for typing on my android phone or ipod touch  and am always erasing and correcting  so a pen helps me a lot this smart pen is well made and doesn't look cheap like the last one i used  the soft tip works well on the capacitive touch screens and i'm faster using it than thumbing  it's also useful for drawing in an ipad  though the tip is a bit mushy and takes some getting used to for graphics 
this was easy to install and looks really  really cool   my friends with iphones were so jealous   however  it is awkward   when you talk on the phone  you have this weird flap   what do you do with it   fold it over   let it flap in the wind   it also gets in the way when you want to snap a picture design wise it is beautiful  but it is also hard to clean   it is marble white and one spec of dirt will stick out and i have tried to clean it  but i couldn't get it removed again  it is really cool looking  but awkward to hold when you are using the phone and it probably will look fairly dirty soon   it definitely won't be on my phone for the two years of my contract     
i used this case for two years and today i popped it off my iphone 3gs because it got too dirty in all of the crevices   it has a lot of deep openings that trap dirt and it accumulates after a while   otherwise the protection is excellent   i used the powder trick on the screen  see other posts for the powder tip  and after that i never experienced screen bubbles   this case is really for exposing your phone to hard core abuse   looking back  i think it was a bit overkill for my purpose  occasional home construction work  and i would have been ok with a thinner case   but  this case is cheap insurance if breaking your iphone at the roller derby would be a personal disaster 
this was what i needed    a clip that is low profile  holds devices nicely  and stays put  the adhesive on the suction cup is strong  so be forewarned  i could see someone hurting themselves trying to muscle it off a surface 
the cable feels solid and has the smooth feel and sturdiness to it  the cable is recognized by ios7 which has been very discriminating to 3rd party cables after its latest firmware update  the lightning terminal bulb is just a tad bigger than the original cable so you have to make sure it fits the opening on your iphone case if you are using this for your phone  other than that  this is  a product that is of good quality and is highly recommended  the extra reach is a plus 
i was a little skeptical about this case when i ordered it    it actually fits great  easy access to all buttons and ports  back actually seems like quality leather instead of plastic  price was phenomenal all in all a great buy 
this is a good case  but the texture is almost like fuzzy fabric  which i find slightly off putting  the two pieces do fit together fairly snugly  but there is no snap or retention mechanism other than friction  so i'm not sure whether or not it will get loose over time  finally  there are two quality issues  first the seams are more visible than i'd expected and the usb port cut out is small enough that several of my micro usb plugs won't fit  luckily  i have a few that do fit  including the factory supplied cable  which fits  but barely   it makes a nice alternative to a tpu case if you don't like the smooth plasticy feel of tpu update  i'm used to the texture and have had the case for a week  i upgraded my review from 3 to 4 stars  because this really is a nice case and is definitely one of the better choices for the money  i wish duzign would release a similar model for the nexus 7 fhd 2013 
pretty good   soft in the ears but can fall out just as easy  works with most phones like any other brand no added benefit to buying the samsung name
the case is great for all the early adopters  however  the buttons have little feedback and you can't tell if you have pressed the correct buttons correctly  being the volume rocker or power button  the case itself is great  it's slim  i have the grey color which looks nice and sharp imo  the ports are easily accessible and the speaker cutouts are perfect  also happy with the free screen protector  also spigen not a cheap fleabay one   the screen protector is a dry application  so there will be no orange peel effects on the screen you get with wet applications  but you have to be very careful not to get any dust underneath during the install  wash your hands before you perform the install  also have a few strands of scotch tape ready to take lint off from behind the protector 
these are awesome   i was worried when i purchased them for two reasons   my phone goes flying alot  and i stuff it in my pocket daily   these silicone cassette covers are as functional as they are stylish and up to date    d  no but seriously  my phone has his the ground a few times already and it bounces right back   in addition  the silicone is actually really slippery  so it slides in and out of my pants pockets easily some people complained that their covers didn't have charger slots  all 3 of mine came with the pre cut holes for everything  and everything lines up perfectly   honestly  i'd pay like  15 each for these iphone cassette covers 
unlike other usb chargers you buy on the market  this ox 10 from omilabs comes in a nice travel case  with a wall charger  some adapters  although it lacked the latest lightning adapter type for apple products  it had the older one  this has a 10000mah battery power  so you could charge a smartphone 4 5 times over  with it's dual usb output you can charge two devices at the same time  for tablets it has a 2 1a output to charge those faster vs the 1a output of the other port  this is a quality well made product  it even has a built in led light if you ever need a light in those dark situations  led indicators show remaining charge of the usb charger  so you aren't guessing how much juice is left  this is a really nice package deal  and great for those who travel  i'd highly say its a good buy to keep those mobile devices charged on the go 
the case provides good protection  its a rubber bumper with a hard plastic cover similar other brands   the kickstand works but i don't know how long it will last  it's a slide in  not snap in and only goes in face down  seems to hold the phone in pretty tight 
i like this case  offers medium protection at a very good price  the rubber is a little too tacky for me  difficult to insert and remove from my pockets  work nicely  though 
i'm using this case on the verizon version of the galaxy s3 i had a diztronic case on the phone for about 6 months and it did a great job protecting it  i was looking for something similar  for a change of pace  and decided to try the cruzerlite case the case is very similar to the diztronic  it adds about the same amount of  bulk  to the phone  which is very little  a couple of the cutouts are a little bigger on this case with the main one being the camera lens  it looks like it will still protect the lens but it is noticeably bigger i really like the blue color with the android on the back  i also like the fact that the edges are ribbed for a little extra grip while holding it overall  i'm happy with my purchase  i would recommend this case if you are looking for a nice looking case that doesn't add too much bulk to the phone 
i really like this case as it is very easy to put on and to take back off the phone  i carry it in a pocket most of the timeand have not had any problem with it coming into  on off button does work very hard though 
it doesn't hold any much juice  it's weird especially the on button   there's no off button when removed the phone   it kept staying on until the juice runs out   not much of a back up plan  the worse product i ever purchased
it lasted only 11 months of very light usage it is also easy to depress the button by accident while in the bag  and ended up turning on the laser for a long period of time unintentionally 
not the best but not bad  you get what they say  it is so much better then the thin ones that u put on but u have to use the spray not liking that on a cell phone but still good just take ur time
this is an easy to put on screen protector  all you have to do is be in a calm clean environment  in other words  no wind  not on a dirty table  and wash your hands first  it looks good when on and fits well  when its new you hardly know its there  it is not edge to edge  but with a slim case you won't see the edges  the bad thing that i have not experienced before is the easy scratching and smudging  i have never owned a protector that attracted so many spots  smudges  scratches  i am very careful not to put my phone in situations where it could get scratched  in other words  i treat it as if it has no protection  having said that  it comes with three protectors and is half or 1 3rd the price of other protectors   if you don't mind having to swap it for a new one every three months or so  i would say buy 
works great  i have an older model car  1998 to be exact   tested it on the galaxy s3 and hubby is satistied with his father's day gift  if you have a heavy cellphone cover  it may cause it to need adjustment before you place them on  weight plays a roll but it works also on my note 2  thank you 
this bow is so cute  i love it  i just lose it all the time  i hate that  but otherwise super cute
these pens really help with touching those small numbers on my   34 dumb  34  phone   the pen provides a nice  smooth tip for writing and the stylus end works great 
this product is close to being perfect for my verizon samsung n ii   positives  perfect fit  the corners protects the phone completely   one drop from about 3ft to concrete no problem   nice compartments for id  credit cards and money  small amounts folded   quality material  appears well stitched and constructed   only one negative from being a 5 star  the snap closure   i have to fiddle with it a little bit to finally get it to close   i prefer a magnet closure   other than that it a great product 
really i bought the black one  but this is such a good phone that i want everyone to know it  i have to say that i own a lumia 928 and loved the simplicity of windows phone  coming from an android device from a galaxy that shall remain nameless  i heard about this phone and started thinking i don't need lossless zoom or any of that stuff  then i went to the store and tried the camera  wow was i impressed  not only does it take better  sharper  clearer  it blows the doors off my year old digital camera with a 20x optical zoom  i can not say enough good things about this phone  if you love taking pictures get it don't wait just get it  i love the app selection  there is not a single app that i am missing from android contrary to what they were telling me in the store that i went to  i have them all instagram in the form of an awesome app called instance  facebook  hulu plus you name it most likely it is there  again i love love love my phone and won't trade it for anything out there 
i can charge two iphone 5's with this device from empty to full  without a problem   this device was really helpful to us during a prolonged power outage during recent winter storms   we had no electricity  but thanks to the backup power of this battery we were able to keep our phones charged up to stay in touch with important news updates and to reach the power company for service restoration updates 
i live in an area where cingular service is really good  i have experienced virtually no dropped calls   the phone itself is not one that i picked or researched extensively   my son tossed my old phone into the wash and thanks to the insurance i had previously purchased i got this phone as a replacement   it is longer and wider than my old motorola phone but it is also thinner   i was concerned about the thickness and durability   this phone is also metal so i feel more confident using it than i did my previous motorola phone my old accessories don't fit even though it is the same manufacturer this just seems silly but what can you do i purchased motorola phonetools 3 0 by avanquest for my previous phone   i plugged my new phone in and the program automatically updated to 4 0 and it prompted me to add a profile for my current phone   with this program i can make my own ring tones and manage my address book and sync it with outlook so i don't have to worry about saving my settings to my sim chip   i also put my favorite picture of my phone dunker and his brother in my phone's memory and i use it as my wallpaper my bluetooth accessories work better with this phone than my previous motorola   on that phone the connection between the earpiece and the phone would suddenly stop functioning   i could not hear anyone through the earpiece or using the phone and to make it function i had to power the phone off and on each time i used my bluetooth headset   annoying the razr and my jabra work well together   it works great for voice dialing in my experience and i can answer the cell and drive   though i rarely do this because i am one of those people who actually like to be unreachable sometimes so i am very happy with this phone but in fairness to other reviewers i did not have specific expectations when i acquired this phone 
gave purple silicone rubber gel soft skin as a gift  the color was great and has great texture which helps with gripping 
the cable is not premium in any way  but it does work exactly as described   the cable is stiffer than the original apple cable and the connectors don't seem quite as firm when plugged in   but it works  so i am using it 
the battery worked just fine for maybe the first couple of days that i had it  then it started doing this weird thing where it only charges to like 85  then somehow goes up to 100  within 5 minutes of me unplugging it  then it drains pretty quickly  also was weirdly big for my phone  like i had to kind of jam it into my phone  i don't recommend this battery
this case is perfect for me and the note 2  the stand kicks out easily and props up the phone without an issue 
i got this case because of the cool pattern  however  the design flakes and peels off on well worn areas of the case 
good looking protection without bulk  colors vary a bit from the pictures but other than that fits great and does the job
it works fine on kindle fire hd 8 9  also works fine on samsung galaxy s4 and iphones  but it will not charge a samsung note 
works great   my iphone fits perfect inside of the case    stays sturdy on my arm while i work out def worth it
i bought this cover for my sister in laws phone  the galaxy precedent and it fits perfect  looks great and she loves it 
again this item was shipped on time  but was extremely poor quality  the bumper did not fit correctly on my phone so i was unable to use the buttons on the top and side  was very dissappointing
the smartwatch is quite big and is definitely for men  after cutting the band for the right length it sits nicely on your hand  and can be worn on either hand  it gets charged in about two hours  and you do not need to plug it  just put on its stand  and it gets charged wirelessly  the software was easy to install on the smartphone  and it was easy to connect the device to it my favorite feature is the watch's screen   it is nice and sharp  quick to update  much quicker then any of our e ink readers would update  it shows time weather notifications etc quite good  double tap on the screen's edge turns on off the backlight so it is visible in the dark my main complaint is with the buckle   it is very hard to unfasten  i had to use a tool to pry it open   there is a wire going around it that you are supposed to pick with your nail  but it didn't feel like it would work without ripping the nail  i hope it will get looser after a time 
this is the second time i buy this cable  ixcc  10ft  ten feet    white extra long extended length usb sync cable   it seems to hold better that others i have tried  i need the length because the 3' cords that come with the items do not reach where i put the ipad to charge and find myself leaving it on the floor  this cable eliminates all that  also  it is durable when compared to others even when compared to the ones sold by apple at double the price for a 3' long cable  those tend to tear and break at the connector piece due to wear and tear  the first ones i purchased from this vendor have lasted longer and do not seem to have an signs of wear  great product 
this speaker is awesome  i was a little skeptical about purchasing a wireless speaker as i have never had one before  i did a little hands on research at the apple store  but was unable to actually open up a box and listen to the sound differences  i was deciding between this jambox speaker  the bose mini  and the beats pill  i risked it and bought the jambox speaker because it was cheaper  and the ratings supported it i've had it for two days  and so far  i love it  i have yet to charge it  so the battery has lasted me two days with moderate use  it connected very quickly to my phone  and i was ready to turn it on  i have an iphone 5s and the speaker on the phone isn't bad  it just can't go as loud and has no bass  this speaker is loud and you can feel the bass  it actually vibrated itself a little when i turned on a song that was rich in bass one feature i didn't know it had  is that it can also be used a speakerphone  i have not used it for this  but my phone has rang while playing music  the jambox paused the music and started reading to me who was calling  definitely a nice feature i would recommend plugging it into your computer and downloading the latest software a side feature is that while your phone is connected via bluetooth  it displays the battery life of the jambox on your phone  a nice feature a feature of the speaker is that  when you turn it on  there is a voice that talks to you to say something similar to   jambox on   via the jawbone website  you can change the voice and sounds that the speaker makes for different things such as connecting to your phone  or low battery  i chose the  mobster  voice  which is actually pretty cool  simple features that make the jambox more fun to use the speaker delivers crisp loud audio  surprising for the size of the thing  so far i am very impressed by it and wish i would have bought one sooner included was the usb adapter  wall charger  and an audio cable to plug directly into the speaker as opposed to using bluetooth beats or bose may be better  but i'm not complaining about the jambox  way cheaper  great sound edit  so  maybe a little more than two weeks after owning the jambox  i decided to sent it back  i became disappointed with the sound and it seemed like the bass became quieter i decided to buy the bose sound link mini instead  yes  it is  199  but after owning it for about a week  i like it more  the sound is better  and the bass is amazing i liked the jambox speaker  but i like the bose sound link mini more 
i thought this case was going to be my favorite  but it turns out it is very slippery   i cut out art pics to change the look of the case and it looks good  but the texture just turned me off and i added it to my catch all drawer 
works well
got this for my husband a while ago  and it's just ok  not that user friendly and does weird things like showing a voice mail message when there isn't one  it's fine for the few times it's used though  which is as a spare 
i've been using the first version of these for years  and absolutely love them  yes  to the untrained eye  a bluetooth headset with a wired headset may seem ridiculous   but anyone with an android device knows we lack the cool three button remote  wired  product iphone users have  so  in order to use my monster beats headphones and get full button control  i use the jabra street2  this way  i can keep my  800 phone in my pocket  out of view of anyone interested in taking a grab at it sound quality is not as good as the originals  and i sense some more  hiss  in the background  other than that  i was disappointed to see that jabra changed little else  the least they could have done was switch to microusb for the charger  as that is the defacto standard nowadays  sadly  this seems like a case of  slap a 2 on it and be done with it  as nothing really seems improved over the old one  which has been around for years  still  it is a great product if you need some more music control with good wired headphones 
the case fits nicely on an iphone 5  unfortunately  after a couple of months of use  the rubberized coating wears off and it looks worn and dirty  case mate was nice enough to offer me a replacement  but i chose a refund instead i got the ringke slim case instead  and after 9 months of use  it is still looks like new  overall  it is probably the best case i have ever owned for an iphone  or blackberry even   it even has a place to use a tether  great when outdoors or around water  
otter box speaks for itself  it has become household name in the phone case department  it's a shame they won't make covers for nexus 5  
i bought this for my wife's phone and she loves it  spigen makes great thin cases  i have 2 for my iphone 
this official samsung 1 0a home wall ac travel charger   cable works perfectly with the samsung galaxy s3 smartphone   the cable fits into the travel charger securely   i'm tempted to get another to keep in an rv so one will always be on hand   the only shortcoming is the length of the cable itself   an additional foot in length would have been nice 
there are cheaper generic tags available  but i wanted to try just a few and didn't want to chance compatibility issues with my samsung s3   these erase and take new info just fine i use these in just a few places so actually have two extra   the samsung app has limited things it can do  so i use nfc task launcher which is also free  it changes more settings  and also will create a tag that will toggle between two profiles as an example  one tectile is in the car   when i get in  i tap it and it turns on gps  bluetooth on  cell network on  display time out to 10 minutes  wifi off  and maybe another setting or two   tap it again and it all goes back another is by the bed and it toggles the led light off  screen rotation off  and a few other settings   tap in the morning and it goes back i have one by the washer and dryer   tap once to set a 30 minute alarm or timer for the wash   tap again for an hour for the dryer you can also launch an app  send an sms  call someone  start an email  open a website  put a vcard on it  and some other settings   just download some nfc apps ahead of time and you can check what they can write to the tagsi tried some of these things just to see if they worked  and they did   not sure when most of those would be used since bar codes or qr codes do many of those and are usable by most smartphones while hardly any have nfc   plus you can create the bar codes online for free  but it is still nice that so many things can be done with the tags 
beware    this does not fit the droid razr maxx xt912  this will fit a regular droid razr  the package even said xt912 but will not fit  it is made for the standard droid razr  not a maxx the back off the maxx would not fit this case because of the larger battery capacity 
it's not a very exciting product until you are stranded somewhere with a low battery  a nearby outlet and no charger plug  the sharkk dual port usb plug  5v 2 1a  15w  provides a quick charge for a low price the plug's  feet  collapse into the smooth  rounded corner compact case  making it easy to pack and carry  in real world testing  it put my iphone 5 from 73  to 100  in less than 20 minutes   quite impressive especially if you are in a hurry it has two usb ports enabling multiple device charging at the same time   another plus  no glow light  which eliminates unwelcome nighttime ambient lighting that some charge plugs cause  this plug is a bargain compared to others that cost up to four times more  five stars disclaimer  i was provided a sample of this product to independently test in normal operation situations and provide an impartial review  arelunde
if you run skype on an apple ipad  this is the perfect solution to turn your ipad into a real phone for about  30 year  you can get a skype phone number  which turns your ipad into a real phone  as long as it's connected to a wifi hot spot  receive calls  dial out this receiver is clear  looks a bit geeky  but hey  it works put your ipad into a bag and this looks like one of those retro phones in a bag 
the casing fits well  material is pretty durable  i would purchase it again  not the top of the line but it's relatively inexpensive to get
my wife and daughter really love these for the tablets i got them for christmas   they glide smoothly across the screen  allow for more pinpoint work and cut down on the finger smudges on the screen   i think they are one of the few  if not only  retractable ones i was able to find online   nice protection for the micro knit tip 
even though i ordered the wrong size they still worked great after a little trimming  still going strong after 2 months and plenty of use   
purchased on a groupon deal after seeing angela's fantastic video  i'm very pleased with this rugged  protective case for my iphone 4s   no  it's not particularly pretty  but it does meet us military standards for protection against water  dust  accidental drops and crush protection i usually use theotterbox defender series case and holster for iphone 4 4s   frustration free packaging   blackand have been very pleased with the protection it has provided   i've dropped my phone a few times and thanks to otterbox  no damage done   the otterbox armor series was always out of my price range  but when i saw it so heavily discounted  only paid twenty five for it      i decided the additional protection it offered was worth considering installation this case is easier to put on your iphone 4 4s than the defender two part method   once you release the two metal clamps on the side of the case  you can easily slip your phone into the case and reverse the process to secure it   port covers waterproof the phone when in place  but they have to be secured for this to be so protection from water   down to 6 6' for 2 minutes and 30 seconds   that's enough time to fish it out of the toilet or a koi pond  but you won't want to take your phone scuba diving from drops   up to 10'   this case provides excellent protection from drops out of your jacket pocket or car  but you won't want to toss it from the roof of your second story house from dust   provides a dust free environment for your phone   if it's clean when it goes in the case  it'll be clean when it comes out from crush   this case is designed to withstand your vehicle running over it with your phone inside  assuming your vehicle is under 2 tons suggestions per otterbox insert   test your case in water for 30 seconds prior to installing your phone   inspect case after every impact to ensure protective properties are not compromised    always good advice    if you remove your phone  check the inner seal for dust or debris prior to re installing to ensure protection overall  the 4 layer protection offered by the otterbox armor series is superior to any other i've found   it can be charged in the case using a standard 30 pin cable and the on off and volume buttons work well however  it's bulky  and call volume on my end suffers when in this case   the ringer on off button is very stiff and difficult to maneuver   the built in screen protector sometimes negatively affects the touchscreen responsiveness in my opinion  no case is perfect in terms of style and function   this protective case is very good for active people who want to protect their expensive phone from drops and liquid  but it is hefty  obscures phone call volume and not waterproof for long periods of time 
bought for a friend and she seems to like it a lot birthday present        she seems to like the case a lot 
i bought this to protect my square reader and it works great  protects it well and makes my reader easy to find in my bag 
this device does so much of what i wanted it to do and a lot more   i was able to run a sprint airave and wireless bridge for well over 3 hours  probably more like 4 or 5 but i wasn't around when it actually died    being able to connect any 12v and 9v devices to this is an amazing feature that comes in handy more than you would expect   the wall charger also charges extremely fast   what is most amazing about this device is that it is small and light for the amount of power that it actually packs   if you need a decent backup battery look no further than this one 
charged the power bank fully and my phone  put the phone n the case used it ran the phone to 13  turned on the power bank and it did not charge my phone at all  re charged the power bank to full  and phone repeated the process and again it did not work  returning it and spending the money to buy a juice box  would not buy this item        meh 
the ixcc 6 2 amp 4 port wall charger is a powerful wall charger that can charge up to 4 devices at once pros  2 usb ports that have an output of 2 1 amps  5 volts 2 usb ports that have an output of 1 amp  5 volts cable that runs from the wall outlet to the 4 port charger easy to read labeled usb ports good price can charge 2 ipads  ipad air and ipad 2  and 2 smartphones  iphone 5 and galaxy s4 at full speed cons  annoying blue led that could light up a dark room at night charger is rather large not ul listedthis is a great wall charger and i recommend it i was supplied a sample for test and evaluation  and i promised that my review is fair and honest 
i dont understand the point of packaging a screw driver if it cant open the screws  i have ordered the screwdriver separately  the plastic covering the flash doesn't look good 
i got this case about a month ago and i love it  i never keep the same phone case on for more that 2 weeks but i have had this one on ever since i got it  many other reviews say that it was so hard to get off or broke after a week but i have to say  i have dropped my phone  with this case on  about 12 times and it hasn't been scratched or shown any signs of being close to the breaking point  i also had to restart my phone it shut down in the middle of a software update so make sure you plug your phone into charge while updating  people   and while it was plugged into the computer to be fixed  i easily got it off   all you have to do it stick your finger into the place where the case connects to itself and boom  i easily popped it off   so i would totally recommend this case to younger teens  like myself  who like cute cases and drop them a lot  
we bought several speck cases  both grip and plain 'candyshell'  and liked the look and feel however  each case  used by different people  began to fray at the edges and gradually tear just belowthe phone's 'home' button   i was seriously underwhelmed by speck's customer support andwon't buy their cases again   so far  the elago 5c slim fit cases are holding up well 
this has been fabulous  very sturdy  my phone fits it nicely  even in the  thin  case  much better than the samsung one that i had earlier 
although it was double bagged this cover had goober stuff all over it   luckily it cleaned up nice   received quickly looks nice and fits perfect   cut outs are spot on  i also like that it has a slick finish so that it goes in your pocket or purse easily 
when the first cell phones came out to the general public in 1983  the cell phones werebulky  and bigger compared to the cell phones we use today  the earlier cell phones did not haveinternet streaming nor could you get apps or music  the cell phones were more like a home phonecompared in size and looks and they were not touch screen like they are today  however we sawmany small phones in the last couple of years and it seems that the sizes of the cell phones aregetting bigger and more high tech  the lg optimus g pro is a very big phone with a 5 5 inchscreen i have been using the lg optimus g pro for two months now and i love it  it has not givenme any problems at all  at first i was skeptical about the size but now i have grown used to thesize  a problem i did encounter however was that i could not find many accessories available forthe phone  so i had to buy my phone cases online  other than that the phone is wonderful i use iton a day to day basis the battery life lasts all day but i do charge it every night  the phone itself isvery fast whether it is opening an app  watching a video or simply turning the phone on or off the lg optimus g pro is a new phone that just came out and it is compared a lot with thesamsung galaxy note 2  they are about the same in size and shape and the optimus is cheaper  buti chose to get the lg optimus g pro because of its features  when watching videos on the phoneyou see a very sharp and bright video without any pixels  they also load up really fast  the phoneis also very loud for having one speaker on the back  the phone also has a lot of internal storageand you can also expand that by inserting a sd card  i did this and now my phone has a lot ofcapacity for my photos  music and apps i love to take pictures and this phone does the job for me  the phone has a 13 megapixelcamera on the back and a 2 1 megapixel on the front  so this phone is a good phone for takingpictures  when taking pictures you can enhance the sharpness of the picture before taking it something that i really like about the phone is the home button because it has lead lightssurrounding it  so when i get a message or a missed call the home button turns green and when iget mail it turns purple this phone is also very good for multitasking i can have three different things running onthe screen  i usually have the calculator  a video and texting on the screen at the same time and thisdoes not cause the phone to work slower  it continues to run fast  when downloading apps ormusic or anything else  they are downloaded very quickly on to the phone  the phone also has avoice command which has come in handy for me because sometimes i do not feel like typing andthe voice command picks up everything very good i have not had a problem with it the phone also has a rotating screen so you can use it horizontal or vertical  the phone canalso be personalized to my likings so i can change everything to the way i would like them  someapps that i use daily on the phone is pandora  instagram  twitter  and the phones music player andthey run great everything gets loaded fast which i like  i also read a lot on the phone and with thebig screen i can read clearly and the words are not small  internet streaming on the phone is verynice and fast  so i can search for something very quickly and it is not difficult to use or i can usethe google search engine on my home screen a downfall about the phone for me is that i usually like to have my phone in my pocket butseeing as this phone is larger compared to others it does not fit in my front pocket and it sticks out alot in my back pocket  so i am usually holding the phone in my hand which is a bad idea because ican lose it easier that way  however i do love the size of the phone but i do not really like carryinga purse with me all the time  but all in all the phone works wonders for me i made a good choicein getting the lg optimus g pro 
while it blocks a bit of the screen on the radio  that's to be expected considering where it mounts  although it occupies the cd slot  i can still play cd's with it in place  it holds my ipod classic or my iphone tightly  it's great for using navigation apps on the iphone 
nice length and a quality product  this is the first time i've ever purchased a product from rnd and i love the quality and practicality of this lightning usb cable 
i like these stylus styli  but i wouldn't call them fine point or acurate  the foan tips are too soft and buldge out when you press hard enough for screens to read  i modified mine with a little cotton on the inside of the tip to make it more firm  now they work great  but i still would call them fine point 
def needs so fine tuning and some additions  namely the clock faces  should have many more available and customizable   the more apps you have on it the more it drains your phone  watch batt stays charged pretty long but it completly kills my phone battery and constantly disconn without reason  besides that it is a neat addition to my ever increasing collection of electronics  have gotton so many compliments on it i should be getting commision from sony because ive sold over 10 people on them and they have purchased one  for the hundred bucks its not a bad buy  just wish there was more for it  fyi get a screen protector immediatly
this is an excellent car charger for a very competitive price  i was a bit worried that the unusual  box  end  where the plugs are  would not fit well into my saturn  the lighter hole is sideways facing  not upward facing  and would be too big  when i got it  it turned out that the  box  end is actually much smaller than i expected  which is good   looks great  and really works well with my car  i use it with one plug facing up and one facing down  so i can easily plug something into the top usb port  this turned out to be much easier than with any other car charger i had before  it looks great and has a solid feel to it as far as the actual charging is concerned  it does well what it is supposed to do  i used it numerous times for my iphone5 when navigating  and it worked flawlessly in summary  this is a great little device that can save your day when your devices run out of battery 
very high quality case that is genuine caseology   beware of counterfeits   soft plastic seems like it would offer protection for phone 
i love my hello kitty phone case  it actually came darker than the picture shows off but neverless it still looks prettty
i bought this case for my daughter after she was admiring my pink case mate pop stand case   she absolutely loves this case   loves the color   she's thrilled with it   had one issue where the jack that's used for the small round port was a bit too short and the plastic part it's connected to was too fat making it not go into the port all the way  but we found one at target that fits perfectly with this case  thank you for a great case at a reasonable cost   
my phone case had broken and i really want a lifeproof case but wasn't quite ready to fork over the money for it   i had looked at otterbox's before but they are expensive too   this one seemed almost too good to be true for the price it is a great case  in the box  with a carrying case  did not realize it would arrive with that    it's a nice size  it feels great  it works great and i really can't rave about it enough what a great buy this is   thank you for offering it and thanks for getting to my door so quickly 
none of the 5 enclosed screen covers would stay on  the edges would unstick and then the rest of it peels off  also  the product i received was not in a labeled package like the one in the picture  very disappointing 
this is a great car charger  love it   the low profile design is nice and won't get in the way with my drink bottles or containers   blue led looks good  and not disturbing   however  not sure if the 2 4amp claim per port is entirely true  but it has no problem charging my phone  tablet   overall  good product 
the case arrived pretty fast and was easy to get onto the iphone   i do love this on the white iphone as it looks sharp   the reason i purchased this version is because of the docking capability however  when i flipped it up to plug the phone into my ihome  it didn't fit  but if i just left the case per norm it did fit on the docking station perfectly   the case has protected the phone from a major drop at the gym  it fell from the top of the machine to the bottom of the elliptical without any damage to the case or the phone   i would buy the case again  but i do wish that speck would sell the case with a screen protector 
i love how this keeps the phone safe and it is way more lighter than when you have a case on it  i think it is so cute 
i love it i dont really use it much only on special occations  i really dont want the pearls to fall off 
easy to put on   off when i had this phone   used these  they were so easy to use   lasted a very long time 
went on well   others have complained about the curved screen being hard to put on protector  but went on well and looked great   my wife did take it off  and it was difficult to put back on having been removed  but that is to be expected 
i need a case for work so i don't have to worry about banging into things   great case for the money very secure
perfect little phone stand  does just what i needed holds my phone  i don't mind turning it sideways to plug in earbuds or to charge it  i use it at work  so discretion is needed with the music 
this product is still holding up  i keep it a work as a back up for when i need to charge my phone
these were advertised to fit the habra stone   they did not  i don't know if they changed the advertisement since then but it was aid to be a package with the habra stone so i got it  not even one piece fit   threw them away
i have always loved belkin and this case is another thing they do well  the purple actually coordinates with the green and the pink iphone 5c's we have    which is nice  i thought it would only work with the pink  the case goes on easy and the buttons are all easy to push with the case on  the case also seems to protect well  i have yet to drop the phone with the case on  but i feel confident that the phone is protected 
not really happy with these  they don't stick to my phone at all so i basically paid to just throw hem in the trash i'm just gonna buy some at walgreens or walmart because they seem to be better quality there
this is the third of these i've ordered  it's no otter box  but the price is great  slow shipping though  since it comes from china  i don't mind that though  they usually show up right about the time i've forgotten i've ordered them and it's a great surprise 
ordered thru amazon online after countless research found  this product really like the way it looked delivered to my house on time looks great fit is perfect great quality i highly reccomend it   
i would strongly recommend  this works great and does exactly what it should says  it stays in place and best yet  the phone or device doesn't stick to it whenever you try to pick it up 
i cannot say enough about this phone   i am so sure any one purchasing it will just love it   easy to read  use and fun   i loaded screensavers off my own pc to the sd card   it is well worth the money  especially with the 1200 minutes you get with it 
this is my 2nd anker external battery  my previous one was smaller but still very effective  however the usb port became loose and though i could recharge the charger  it would not charge a device  i was issued a full refund by amazon  that brought me to this purchase  i have only had it a few days but it still has at least 1 2 it's charge and i have done a full charge to my lg spectrum twice  it has 2 usb ports so that you can charge 2 devices simultaneously which i have not done yet  it is bigger than my first and heavier and it isn't really practical to carry around or put into pockets  unless you have a front hoodie pocket  but it is nice to have when you don't have an electrical or ac outlet  i would purchase this again and am considering doing so for my son's tablet  especially when on road trips and because it has poweriq technology  i feel comfortable using it on any of our devices safely  it comes packaged very well  i also recently bought one of their car chargers  which does seem to charge my phone faster 
i just bought these as a backup for when the one that came with my stylus starts giving up   i love the stylus and that i can just replace the tips and not the whole thing 
the case is exactly as described and i love it  i was worried when i selected it because of the description but this was unfounded  the inner rubber cover fits like a glove and the outer hard shell snapped right into place  it perfectly matched the color of my phone to the original color  if you have this phone  this is the perfect companion 
the speck candyshell flip case is a unique option for your iphone 5 that allows you to completely expose the bottom of the phone  including the dock port and the 5's newly repositioned headphone jack  via a rubber hinge   the hinge works well in both directions  so it's easy to both uncover the bottom of the phone and then replace the lower portion of the case   when the phone is fully installed in the case  the candyshell flip provides good shock protection without adding a lot of undue bulk on any side   one of its nicest features is a rubberized lip around the front  so you can put the phone face down and not worry about scratching the screen   all buttons are covered but fully functional on the downside  the gloss black exterior is extremely  i'll say it again   extremely  susceptible to scratches   within a day or two of having my candyshell flip  my sleek new iphone 5 was reduced to looking older and more beat up than the old phone it had replaced   and that was just from being transferred from my pocket to my desk and back again the slickness of the case also makes it easy for the phone to slip out of your grip   i would have preferred that they use the rubberized material all the way around the edge   doing so wouldn't have negatively impacted the looks of the case while adding more security when gripping this large phone finally  i'm not sure that the flip feature will be as necessary for the iphone 5 as it may have been for the 4   we purchased our candyshell flips because we have so many items for docking our phones  but since these legacy devices all require an adapter now between the 30 pin and new  lightning  connector  thanks a ton  apple   your adapter may not require that you expose the entire docking port   for example  we are using the 30 pin to lightning cable  rather than the stubby connector block  and it fits just fine with the case completely on   i also haven't found any headphone jacks that don't work with the candyshell flip completely installed  although there might be some out there overall  unless you are sure that you will often need to have unencumbered access to the bottom ports of your phone  i would recommend another case that will hold its looks and or prevent accidental drops more than the candyshell flip does 
i'll admit i don't normally use capacitive styluses  but the main reason has been that the el cheapo ones i've tried just plain stink  often they simply don't work  i've had the chance to try out several rubber tip versions and usually got fed up and tossed them out  or  if that made me feel bad for filling up a landfill  gave it to someone else who probably tossed it out   they usually get stuck on a clean screen and sometimes don't even register properly when in contact with the screen  this is the first rubber tipped stylus that i've found actually is practical for use on smartphones and tablets  furthermore  it's a really nice pen the business styluses are attractive and look like typical pens you'd wear in a suit pocket  they have a flush cylindrical cap that fits on very tightly to prevent drying out  the stylus tip is on the rear and has replaceable rubber nubs  this type of stylus  i find  is a lot more practical than the type that plugs into the headphone jack  you might at first think those are handier  but they actually aren't   they tend to get in the way when you stow the device and often don't stretch long enough to be used without unplugging  they also aren't anything other than a stylus  and although i don't mind using one to keep the screen clean if my hands are dirty or if i want an implement to scribble a memo  i still do like to use my fingers for the most part the best part though is the pens  i'd actually say these are worth buying just to use as pens  they're really good rollerball ink  with a very consistent flow and bold stroke  it does bleed through if you hold it down  which is typical of any non gel roller  but as far as those go it's equal to or better than any other i've seen  including some very pricey ones like parker and cross   they are refillable as well  and the cover fits over the stylus end so you won't lose it when writing the pack comes with a small micro fiber cloth  which is always useful  for the price and quality  this is a great deal any way you look at it i received this bundle free of charge to review 
as pictured described  very nice quality  thin but sturdy   i attached this to my cell phone case so i can have a leash if the phone flies out of my hand in a klutzy moment 
i chose this belt click that is comfortable and have good price i like it so cheap and easy to use recommend anyone to buy an equal  not regret
spend the money get one that will last  that's my conclusion with car mounts  this one is good quality and not overly expensive  only complaints being that the vent mount is worthless and the dash sticky pad will not hold up in hot car  had to get some 3m sticky tape to replace that      
if you want a bumper for a very cheap price that protects it well and lasts 6 months  this is it  i wouldn't rate this product 5 stars if it was 15 dollars  but for this price its awesome 
it took a good while to be delivered and the micro usb cable is a little short  short and sweet  great for a spare charger but not worthy of being your day to day charger  it works great with my galaxy s4  my kindle fire and my nexus 7 fhd gen 2   i think the purchase is a good one just for the plug and the fact you can change out the cable for a longer one is a simple fix to the only complaint i have  it took nearly a month to arrive so the 3 stars are a rating based on the long wait and the shorter cable 
i have several wall chargers for my ipod and ipad   i even have one with dual charging ports  but none of them are of this quality   i can't really trust any of them   not so with the ismooth fast dual usb wall charger for apple devices   this is a heavy duty item and the fit and finish is excellent   it just feels dependable i have tested it out on both my ipod 5g and my ipad2   the charger works perfectly   now i will take it with me on my trip to great britain next month   the charger can be used with both 120v and 220v wall sockets without a transformer   it will  however take an adapter for non american outlets the standard two prong connector can be removed  to reveal one of those two port sockets that will accept a computer battery charging cable   i was surprised to find that feature  but am not sure how i might use it   it must have an application the charger is just a tad larger and heavier than the others on the market  but that is acceptable to get the high quality built into this device this is unit will charge an ipod and an ipad at the same time as advertised   and i think it may very well be the best of its kind on the market the only thing i would wish for would be a way to retract the electrical prongs for travel 
these are the cheap kind where if you even have a piece of lint in the air  a giant bubble will from   so be aware 
the plug in the back folds in for travel use  which is fine  but initially i found it hard to get the plug to pop out so i could plug it in and give it a try  it worked once  then the plug broke and now when i plug it all the way in  it stops charging  waste of money 
ok so i got the package on time and all as always but thats thanks to amazon anyways  as far as the product is concerned i dont like the fact that the handles are very tight and it really feels like you have to push hard to get your phone in and taking it out is always hard aswell  the product is made well for sure but just not what i wanted since i wanted to install it on the dash and it just comes off easily since its so hard to put the phone in and out
i am pleased with the quality and fit of this cord with my android phones  i have not had any issues with them and i am pleased with my purchase 
i bought this hoping to protect my iphone  the only thing i don't like about it is that it's so bulky  it doesn't slip in   out of my pocket easily at school or at work  i also don't like the idea of the otter box because i can't charge my phone without taking the cover on and off 
new trent's powerpak is small and good for business travelers  students  or workers in a  mobile office   car  field work  etc    the powerpak is small  light  and easy to slip into a briefcase purse backpack and seems like a device that could hold up to constant travel and use  the included micro usb cable is three feet long and a good length  not so long that it gets tangled but no so short that its a hassle to plug in when using in a normal office or hotel room checking the charging and battery level statuses is simple and easy to read when charging in an outlet  flashing greenwhen charging a device  steady green lightflashing red  less than 10   time to charge blue  less than 75 green  75 100 there are three ports on the end of the device  a 2 1a  good for higher powered devices like an ipad 3 4   1a  good for smartphones  ipods  etc   and the charger input  i tested an ipad mini  ipad 3  ipad 4  iphone 5  ipod nano  and droid x2 and all charged easily and quickly  i'd highly recommend this for the size  weight  and overall charging power which is lacking in an increasingly technological society 
best wireless headphones i've owned  good sound quality and decent mic for the use as a phone  i highly recommend this headset and for the price it is a bargain 
i originally tried to purchase through ebay for the fact that i had a coupon   the coupon didn't get activated so i canceled on ebay and purchased from amazon   not sure if that made a difference but my clip defected and cracked the first time i tried to put it all together  the belt clip can't stay open  when i put the device in the holster there's only one way i can get it to fit when facing out and i lose access to the volume rocker i'm still trying to cycle charge but i get at least a days use  i change batteries once a day  my other is an extended anker which is acclimated and gives me about the same usage even though this battery last a whole day once it hits 15 percent my phone automatically starts power limiting and i end up losing the function of various apps that i would regularly have running  so now i'm left with 8 hours of power limited use screen protector is crap  scratched plastic that needs to be removed when actually using the device as a phone i get pinched on the corners of my jawline by the case case quality is okay  could be better  outside rubber is sturdy yet internal plastic is same as plastic plates get it if you really need it  otherwise this is a pass  stick to changeable batteries and a solid defender or something like also i contacted to replace holster   and nothing not even an email to confirm message sent stay away 
the motorola s11 flex hd wireless stereo bluetooth headset puts a different take on what you should expect on a bt headset  it has so far exceeded my expectations as far as audio  fit  range and ruggedness i so desperately wished for in a bt headset  i've had similarly designed bt headsets before  an altec lansing backbeat 906 and an lg tone hbs 700  to which i will be making my head to head comparison  the motorola s11 flex hd wireless stereo bluetooth headset surpasses both the altec lansing and lg in just about all the categories i could think of in a bt headset my impressions fit  the motorola s11 flex hd  as with the other 2 brands i am comparing it with  is an in ear headset but like the altec lansing backbeat  it has a wrap around bar that goes over behind your neck for stability  unlike the backbeat  the s11 flex's wrap around bar is adjustable  it can be adjusted to the contours of your head assuring of a fit that stays and will not fall off  even when you are engaged in a full motion workout or you are running  it simply stays put allowing you to enjoy whatever you are listening to without the constant motion of adjusting it or putting it back on when it goes out of place  it comes with 4 different sized ear buds so you can get the best fit in your ear regardless of the size of the holes of your ear  i must also mention that the fit is very comfortable  i used it for workout lasting a couple of hours and i had no issues with comfort at all audio  the audio of the the motorola s11 flex hd was surprisingly very good  way lot better than the altec lansing or lg headphones that i am comparing this with  for one  the s11 flex hd outputs audio evenly spread on the sound spectrum  listening to music provides a balanced bass and treble  no overly broken highs or lows even if you desire to have the volume a little higher than usual  the lg tone fails miserable in this department  once you turn the volume up  distortion is the name of the game as far as your music listening pleasure is concerned  this is the first bt headset that i had the chance to own with an equalizer functionality  you can set your headset to an equalizer setting that best suits the music you are playing  the phone call aspect of the s 11 flex is great too  i am able to listen to my call and my callers heard me clearly without any kind of background interference  this proved especially true using it when the car windows were rolled down  the noise cancelling was great and we were able to maintain a clear conversation despite the wind noise connectivity  i had no problems connecting the s11 flex with my android phone and my ipod touch  i have 2 android phones  one with a 4 0 ice cream sandwich os and the other a 2 3 gingerbread os and the s11 flex connected without any issues  i was also able to connect this with a 2nd generation ipod touch without any problems at all range  the s 11 flex boasts a range of 150 feet from your connected device  this is quite an overkill as far as the specified range is concerned  i tried this out on the parking lot of a local grocery store  left my phone in the car and started to walk away  things started to have some distortion from 40 feet out  at approximately 70 feet  the audio was quitting in and out  so i'd say the stated 150 feet range is an overkill  i had no problems roaming around the house with it  depending on the size area of your home  you rarely venture to more than 50 feet in any part of your house  if you do  would be wise to have your device with you and use the bt headset at the same time ruggedness  the ability of the s11 flex to withstand moisture and sweat is an added plus especially when using it while exercising  sweat is acidic and anything that comes into contact with sweat  degrades over time overall  the motorola s11 flex hd bluetooth headset is a great performing headset to have  the functionality and ruggedness of the s11 surpasses other headsets in the same category  very highly recommended 
this quality of this product is inconsistent that is why some people have issues while others don't  for me  i applied the first protector on but noticed it did not have 3 layers  it only had 1 hard layer  tab 1  and 1 soft layer  tab 2   the soft layer attached to my phone  but the number 2 tab was glued to it  i took it off and applied a second protector  this time  it had 2 soft layers and 1 hard layer  peeled off tab 1  placed the hard middle sheet on my phone  and peeled off tab 2 with no problems  the sheets i received fit my lg optimus v from virgin mobile perfectly with no bubbles 
i bought 4 and gave them away as gifts    
too thick for iphone 5s and makes the touch id fingerprint scanner almost impossible to use  if it were thinner and the cut out beveled then i'd probably have kept it 
i received my hard case yesterday  december 18  it arrived on time and i love the way it fits my phone  great product 
this a great case   it fits the samsung galaxy s3 perfectly   would recommend   we received it a day earlier than promised timeline  awesome 
           update    5 21 2014            the company contacted me to enquire further about my dissatisfaction  they have sent me a replacement which is actually better  it makes me think the initial product was defective  the pen is also working so far  i don't know how it turns out to be in a couple of months  but in the meantime i am increasing the rating to 5 stars   mainly for their excellent customer service  sent me a replacement after more than one and half years of original purchase   and a good working product   so far    i will change it based on its functionality over time                  original review                it has never worked the way i have wanted since the purchase more than an year ago  i wanted to use it to quickly jot down a few points in penultimate while working in the hospital  but it fails outrightly and irritates you by missing many alphabets in the whole note  defeating the whole purpose  i basically went back to using my finger tip for writing i tried to find another stylus today  thinking with so many tablets coming up in last one year  they would have come up with something  but still this one comes up in the search as one of the most  reviewer liked stylus  which i really don't understand  i still can't find good one  which doesn't rip my pocket into pieces besides  the pen function also was useless after first couple of months  the nib doesn't even come out any more  i opened the whole thing up  screwed it back in  but it still doesn't come out  it just floats in the stylus now making a rattling noise so my understanding is  this thing is probably okay for general browsing  scrapbook  drawing etc   still missing 20 30  hits on the screen  but is not for even remotely serious note taking 
good price but not a good product  lots of scratch on clear part   
i wanted an inexpensive case for my work phone and this fit the bill perfectly   i like it and it does protect the phone very well 
i love this charger   it is smart  has auto power on when connect to charge your device  automatic stop when your device is full   over charging smart protection  automatically off after 3 4 hours not in use  easy to see the remaining battery level by press release power button  with 4 led lights that indicate each 25  power level remaining  if all 4 led light up mean it is full  i got almost 2 full charges on my iphone with this charger  the power lights help a great deal  it goes with me everywhere my phone does  good customer service  fast shipping 
i received this case and my samsung galaxy s3 fitted perfectly  i used the case 4 days a week and i work in an office setting so it didn't get abuse  the belt buckle came out of the case itself with no way to be able to fix it  only lasted about 3 1 2 mos  look elsewhere 
this is a super slim case but the case doesn't really fit the phone perfectly  the strip at the bottom  where the home button is super thin and is really flimsy  it looks like its hanging off the phone and after a few months of usage  the thin strip finally broke it's okay for the price  but not worth it if you are serious about your phone 
its simple  love the fact that it's like the otter case but the back though it has that finish i did see the finish comming off in about a week due to pocket in and out usage  but by far i paid like 3 dllrs for it so it was good for the price  good protection and for the price i would recomend it  3
outstanding so far  i will update when and after i work out  i mainly mountain bike  use the row machine and cross train with free weights  stay tuned 
solid and reliable  arrived quickly  good value  works exactly as described   
not only are these stylus's adorable  but they work great  the shipping was really fast  too  so far  i'm very impressed  i received my order  opened it up  grabbed the pink stylus and have been using it ever since  not a lick of trouble  the stylus moves freely   doesn't grab to hard or skip  i will order from this seller again 
doesn't add much bulk and has protected the phone from a couple of minor drops   i have purchased 3 or 4 cimo cases and would buy again 
bought this for my son who just got a new samsung galaxy s3 and it's perfect   it fits like a glove with no modifications necessary and was very easy to install   i put the silicone part on first then popped the hard cover on second   worked like a charm   protects his phone and gives him a little grip   he likes that he can lay the phone face down and it doesn't allow the screen contact with hard surfaces   great price and nowhere near as bulky as a otterbox 
wonderful case second one i bought just because i broke the clip but its tough saved my phone many times
i have had this case for a week and i am in love  the size  the look  everything  it fits perfectly and even though i have to push slightly harder to hit the power button  i'm 100  pleased  i wasn't expecting so many compliments either  i thought it was kind of nerdy   but people compliment me constantly on it  girls and guys  i actually would have gotten the classic red  but got so excited when i saw this for so cheap  i just ordered it on the spot 
i just got the new lg g2 for one of my family share lines  and i have to say i am pretty impressed with how much lg has improved since i last used their phone  depending on your perspective  this is either a huge phone or a small phablet pro  fast processorthe g2 runs the new qualcomm snapdragon 800 chip  which is a beast with its quadcore cpu at 2 26 ghz and adreno 330 graphics chip  this is the king of the hill soc at the moment  with the possible exception of apple's new a7 chip in the iphone 5s  i experienced no lag in using the phone   animations in the user interface were all very smooth  paired with 2gb of ram  this phone should still be fairly powerful a year or two down the road  great screenthe screen has always been an important factor for me  after all  it's the main way i interact with the phone  the g2 doesn't disappoint with its huge 5 2  ips lcd running at resolution of 1080p or 1920x1080  ips panel technology is generally recognized to have superior color reproduction compared to the amoled screens samsung uses in their galaxy phones  which produce exaggerated overly saturated colors  in addition  lcds tend to be brighter than amoled screens  which comes in handy when using the phone outdoors in direct sunlight  and finally  ips panels use the full rgb subpixel layout  as opposed to the pentile arrangements used by samsung  which cheats by not using all three basic color subpixels for each pixel  thin bezellg was able to really cut down on the side bezels on this phone by moving the usual buttons to the back of the phone  definitely the closest yet to the mythical  edge to edge  display thus far  innovative inclusion of graphics ramlg implemented graphics ram  gram  in an effort to increase battery life  basically  it's a small amount of memory that allows the phone to avoid waking up the main cpu for low stress tasks  such as when you're browsing and reading a long article  and there's no change to what's being displayed on screen  the gram allows the lcd panel to self refresh instead of waking up the main cpu to do it  which requires more battery juice  obviously this depends on your specific usage pattern  but judging from the phone's excellent battery life  i'd say it's probably helping in some way  great battery lifeas someone who's been fortunate enough to have used multiple devices from motorola  samsung and htc  i can definitely say that the g2 has the best battery life with the exception of the moto droid maxx  it makes sense  since lg threw in a nice big 3000 mah battery  compared to the 3500 mah found in the maxx  the gram is an unique feature specific to g2 which no doubt helps to prolong the battery life  finally  the new snapdragon 800 chip has additional power efficiency enhancements that's not found in the 600 series  used in the samsung s4 and htc one and host others   i am seriously impressed  13mp camera with optical image stabilizationthe g2 is the second android phone to come with optical image stabilization  ois    the first being the htc one  this is very exciting to me  because as a photography enthusiast  i am happy to see features from the real cameras trickle down to the smartphone world  ois helps to smooth out the jitters and vibrations  which are inevitable with smartphones  nokia still has the best ois in the smartphone world  although the htc one comes pretty close  at least in the higher frequency vibrations  the g2 has comparable ois performance to the htc one  and its 13mp sensor is actually the exmor rs sensor made by sony  which is one of the better smartphone sensors currently on the market  not a bad camera cons  lg's android skinto be honest  i've always thought lg's interpretation of android is the worst of all the skins out there  it's cartoony  overly flashy  and just ugly  it's like a drunk version of samsung's touchwiz  which i personally think is a pretty bad interface already  good thing the phone is smooth  my previous experience with lg smartphone  the lg spectrum series  was similar  except back then the lg phones were incredibly laggy and slow  they were borderline unusable  button layoutthe buttons on the back takes some time to get used to  i am okay with it after a day or so  and i have no problem with it  but i could see some people potentially not liking it also  the placement of the buttons on the back means the phone doesn't sit flush on the table when placed down  i thought this took away a little from the overall design  no microsd slot for memory expansionthe phone comes with 32gb with no way to expand  personally i am okay with 32gb  i do clear out the phone periodically and also use cloud services like dropbox  woohoo still have the grandfathered unlimited data   it would've been better if it came with 64gb or more though   non user replaceable batterythe battery is sealed and you can't switch out batteries without taking the phone apart  with the nice 3000 mah capacity though  i don't see this as that big of a disadvantage   so so speaker quality with bad placementthe g2 has a single speaker located at the bottom edge of the phone  there are two grills  but it's only one speaker inside  the quality is average   that is  it's blown away by the htc's stereo  boomsound  speakers  the biggest drawback however is its location  i found that i tend to muffle it with my palm in either landscape or portrait orientation  i have to make a conscious effort to hold the phone a certain way  which is somewhat awkward    double tap  to turn on screen is somewhat hit or misslg has an interesting feature where you double tap the screen to wake the phone  in my experience  this doesn't work all the time  the failure rate is high enough that i've basically conditioned myself to always triple tap  and even then it sometimes still doesn't register  ir tv remote function somewhat barebonelg threw in the ir remote function  first introduced by the htc one and followed by the samsung s4  however  lg's implementation is barebone   it works as the tv remote but doesn't include the extra like htc with the cool channel guide  where you can search for a show or genre and just click on it  and the phone automatically changes the tv to the correct channel   build quality is okay  not greatlg follows its korean brother samsung in using cheap glossy plastic for its phones  and the g2 is no exception  the phone feels cheap to the touch and the glossy plastic is a fingerprint magnet  it's definitely no htc one with its all metal construction  granted  a lot of people put phones in cases  but for me  i take my phones out of their cases when i am not out and about overall  i am truly impressed by the g2  gone are the days of laggy and slow user interfaces that defined lg phones  the battery life is great  and considering that the droid maxx costs  100 more  that just makes it even more impressive  my biggest turn off is the lg user interface  it's just downright ugly  in the end  it's a great phone as long as you're okay with the ui  the phone's sheer size  cheap plasticy construction and unique button placement 
best blue tooth unit i have ever owned  the battery time is wonderful  auto connect is flawless  works okay with dirk but it is only about 50  of the time  i think the car noise is at fault 
i was worried when i bought this case that the graphic on the back would peel off   i have had some issues with that in the past   ive had this case on my phone for about a month and no peeling had occurred  when i got it  i immediately put it on my white iphone 4  it looks great  feels great  and i would recommend anyone to buy this product   
i have been using this pack for several months and it is exceptional  it lasts a very long time and it has made my life so much better  i travel all over the united states and it can be a fight to reach a power source when you need it  i love not worrying about using my phone  do yourself a favor and buy their adapter also  i do not know why it is not included but  it is excellent also 
if you need to extend the battery life on your equipment this will do the job fairly quickly   it's light and elegant  with a charge cable equipped with a velcro wrap to keep things neat and tidy   when you get this unit  it comes charged   depress the status button  and you will see those 4 green lights pictured on the unit  it promises up to 10 hours of extended charge  use it to charge your electronics  and you will lose 2 green lights  or what appears to be half the unit's ability to charge  immediately   but it does charge   it fully charged a kindle fire hd from 12  to 100  in 5 hours   if you try to recharge the upplant2 t  it will take 5 hours   the minute you connect anything to this unit  it appears to lose half the charge which means you don't always know what you've got   the charge cord doesn't give you a lot of confidence that your tylt upplant2 t is giving your 'up to 10 hours '  but it offers more charge time than anything this size  weight and configuration has any right to do so why the 3 stars   this unit has some of the worst documentation i have ever seen anywhere   there is no clear warranty or apparent way to get redress should it be needed   worst of all  in its elegance  this unit is so tightly constructed it was challenging to find out how to use it   the 'manual' was not much help   i had to approach it as if it were a rubik's cube in order to use it at all  or recharge it  so i give it 3 stars and call that fairly generous 
these are of good quality but me being the impatient sort went thru two before i got it right  have three left will buy again if i need them
this is an amazing screen protector for a very reasonable price  no bubbles at all after a few hours  and i was even using the phone right away  it's much better than the zagg i was using on my s3  and it cost almost 75  less 
i've got an older system that still uses rca plugs so that right there is worth it  not very portable as a plug in converter is part of the package  what i needed it for was perfect  sound systems that you'd like to listen to your tablet music  go for it 
wanted to leave a quick review talking about using this with something other than the advertised device  it works great with my nexus 7 fhd  2013   and i have a leather somewhat thick case on it  it is slightly picky about where i place the device to engage wireless charging  but as long as i'm just somewhere near the middle of the device  having the tablet oriented vertically or horizontally  it starts charging immediately  when it starts charging  my tablet  not the charger  makes a little beep  only if i have the volume up  and a small white light comes on the charger  i don't find the light too distracting  did take me 2 nights to get used to  i like to sleep in a cave  and while the light barely puts out any light at all it seemed like it was all i could see the first night  the rate it charges the tablet seems 100  equal to plugging it in  but i can't vouch for that because i only use it at night this charger does exactly what i wanted it for  i want to use my tablet until i'm almost asleep  then just place it on my nightstand without having to pay attention to finding the charging cord  feeling for the proper orientation for insertion  then finding the port with my finger on the bottom of the tablet  i'm a very picky consumer  but i really can't think of anything that could be better about this charging plate 
they say that they fit our evo 4gs but they are to large leaving bubbles on the screen  i opted to not have mine protected i am to ocd to leave the bubbles there  my husband does not mind but it is noticeable that it doesnt sit right on his phone 
got it for my dad  and he does get very picky about things  he loved it  said it let the iphone slip in and out at the touch of a finger  its also the right   34 mini  34  size on the belt  not too bulgy  good quality  since for the lst 2 months it still has its stitches on 
the product is well reviewed so i may have received a dud  the adapter is much too loose which means i have to hold it in place to get a charge  i am beyond my return time so i'll probably order a different one and throw this one way  disappointed 
as the name  amazonbasics  might imply  this is a fairly basic shell case for the iphone 3g 3gs   i actually used mine with an ipod touch 3g positives   the color is a nice deep shade   it is easy to add   remove the device from the case as well   jacks are accessible negatives   the buttons may be more difficult to push once the case is in place   this is true of many protective cases   many cases include a front screen protector   this one does not conclusion   not a bad value for the price point 
i love the case   it protects my phone when its bouncing around my purse or when i accidentally drop the phone   i just wish it came in more colors    like purple  red or green 
does not stick to window or to dash board i even clean the window twice but did not so any good not worth the money no matter how cheap u can get it for
11 15 13  works great for charging my iphone 5s and that is what i wanted it for   i can't comment on other adaptability to other devices as i don't use them  is well constructed and sturdy  but because the lightning adapter end is very small  compared to the 30 pin connector  it will obviously be more fragile  it does require some care to insert and remove from the iphone socket 11 21 13  the plastic cover on the usb connect cam off when i attempted to remove it from a usb socket   the glue that held it in place is defective and doesn't stick to the plastic  however it does hold the wiring in place   i applied two drops of super glue to see if that will work and reinserted the usb connector into the plastic cover   we shall see      lowered rating to 4 stars due to defective manufacture 
i really like the case even though it was a little bulky i like it   but when i tried to use my kick stand it broke and i was a little disappointed its not a major thing but i like the kick stand because i dont have to hold my phone when im watching videos or talking on the phone they were able to ship me another one case since this one broke  
yep  this case is perfect for the pantech ease  they are inexpensive  easy to install and good quality  would recommend to anyone who wants to protect the screen from accidental scratches  size though is just too perfect  you might have to trim the edges a bit before installing though 
the case is very slim and sleek  the feel of the tpu material is great  it also seems like it would offer decent protection for the average user  maybe not enough if you are clumsy with phones the only negative is that the colored area is painted and clear coated and the clear fell off after a while  it wasn't terrible because you can scrape it off with your nail and once its all off the plastic still looks good just not as shiny i have another case from spigen which is not painted and i would recommend they just make that trim without painting it 
since this item is so small they should have included some tweezersto aid in placement  when you swipe your screen  these shields tend to slide
the black leather wallet came in on time in good condition   it was a little smaller than i thought it would be  but still it is very nice   it i done use it someone i know will   the leather wallets are hard to find here in any stores 
the battery works just like the oem battery that came with the galaxy s3  i am getting the same results in battery life using this battery  ravpower is a great company for battery replacements and battery packs ect  i recommend this battery to anyone looking for an extra battery or need an everyday new battery for their gs3 i was supplied a sample for test and evaluation  and i promised that my review is fair and honest 
i love this cord  it looks cool and it holds together really good  my usual iphone chargers fall apart easily but this one works good and has been through a lot and still works 
beautiful vibrant color   good quality leather   a lovely case   very functional   should be able to get long use out of it 
as its obvious from the name hd clear screen protector and it works perfect  provide protection and crystal clear screen   recommended to every samsung galaxy s3 user 
used it for a week and sold my gs3  bought one for my iphone 5 tpu is cheap and doesn't stick in the pocket plus the colors are nice 
this fits my epic 4g touch very well  it doesn't cover up any ports except that for some fat 3 5mm plugs it could block the headphone jack from inserting fully  it looks quite attractive and is generally resistant to scuffs  i think it's protecting my phone well while keeping it sexy and thin  so i'm a fan 
wow this a great product for a great price i bought this original just for the back cover   i had bought a hyperion 4400mah battery and case two months ago on amazonhyperion samsung galaxy siii 4200mah extended battery   pebble blue back cover  compatible with samsung galaxy s iii gt i9300  at t  samsung galaxy s3 samsung i747  verizon samsung galaxy s3 samsung i535  t mobile samsung galaxy s3 samsung t999  u s  cel    but the back cover on it was super slippery  cracked  and the cover didn't sit flush with the camera and the flash resulting in terrible photos especially with the flash enabled when i saw the price of this and the fact that the back cover is flush to the camera and the flash i was sold   i got it today and what a difference my photos are better because the case is flush   the case is also not super slippery and it snaps on much tighter so it looks and feels better in my hand i haven't used the battery at all and probably won't since i already have my hyperion battery charged up but i did notice that the cells on the hyperion and this battery from anker were the same model number and dimensions  so i am pretty sure they are made by the exact same people but i don't know for sure   at any rate you should get at least 1 full days worth of battery with heavy use with this battery given its size
gimmick case  offers no protection for your phone and won't fit in your pocket  cheap plastic that peels  feels like your going to break your phone or the case when you put it in and take it out 
when i got the charger it came in a safe and secure package  opened up and it was just how it looks  shiny and everything  when i went to a restaraunt and was going to charge my phone on the way there  i pluged it in and the light came on  it started charging  but when i got to the restaraunt and i went to unplug it i noticed a burning plastic smell and it was the charger  it was super hot and i wouldnt trust it anymore  i am glad that i only payed two dollars for it because its not worth a penny of what i paid   
this is a decent quality screen protector  if you like matte   i think with any matte protector  the display will look grainy  and this one is no exception   in the end  i decided to put up with glare  which i don't even notice  actually  and have a clearer view  so i bought the tech armor screen protector   it wasn't until i got that one that i realized how easy installation can be   with the ismooth  it was harder to apply without getting bubbles   the tech armor just popped on without a single bubble anywhere  and it covers the screen better than the ismooth to me  there's no comparison  but if you really have to go with matte  this one will work 
very slim and impact absorbent silicone case  the red plastic part is a clip with stand  all buttons and camera ports well aligned  easy to install and will not slip even with sweaty hands will recommend worth the money
this spigen slim armor case is good looking and  more importantly  provides decent protection for the iphone 5  the case is easy to install and leaves unobstructed access to all of the buttons  camera  and ports this is professional looking case that nicely compliments the black iphone recommended cfh
they fit  they work  i have no issues they do randomly have a   34 rainbow  34  ish streak of color  but only when the phone is locked on a black screen   truly it makes no difference to the actual product i would buy again  great value  no complaints 
its a decent well made cover   nothing great but does what it is supposed to do  i would buy it again 
charged up the battery  tested in phone  but battery in phone yesterday  was on skype for a couple of hours yesterday  battery still has 47  capacity today after three hours of turning on my phone this morning   like the added case too  update  phone stats say 14 hours on battery with 44  capacity
this would have been nice only after opening and closing about three times the snap broke  other than that nice item  giving it a two star because of the snap breaking so easily 
i received this fast and it works better than expected to connect external devices to my galaxy tab 10 1 tablet  i had a logitech k400 keyboard touchpad combo   http   www amazon com logitech wireless keyboard multi touch 920 003070 dp b005dkztmg ref sr 1 1 ie utf8 qid 1343744581 sr 8 1 keywords logitech k400  that i used on my htpc   i also have the samsung multimedia dock  http   www amazon com samsung galaxy orginal multi media edd d1b1begsta dp b0059ugy7y ref sr 1 cc 2 s aps ie utf8 qid 1343745073 sr 1 2 catcorr keywords samsung galaxy 10 1 dock   and by putting the galaxy in the dock  attaching this usb dongle to the dock's port in the back  and then plugging in the keyboard wireless usb dongle  it worked perfectly  but for a lark tried it with the galaxy via this usb dongle and with no software it worked perfectly to replace a mouse and keyboard   neither the galaxy or the logitech literature or websites list this compatibility  but it works plug and play and better than the made for the galaxy bluetooth keyboards i tried   no lag  amazing  with just this little dongle 
fits well  volume and power buttons are hard to press but that is better than easily being pushed  durable and cheap  good buy 
i like to do full reviews of the products i order mainly for the device i use the most i got this case as an alternative case to my s5 as i sometimes enjoy running and otheroutdoor activities  so  here are my pros and cons of this case pros  shipping was fast and came simply in an envelope but in its oem packaging which is great  easily removable from the packing and the extra cover colors were well protected  provides support and normal use of all the buttons and sensors on the device adds grip and some umph  to the device handling it while actively in a sport or exercise  provides a safe feeling that if dropped  the device is well protected and will not harm thescreen or hardware  variety of color options goes well with either the device colors or even the preference of theuser which i do like to change the look of my device from time to time  made of strong  rubbery material and a clear and strong screen protector layer that comesalso protected by a piece of film that you can peel off for use cons  may provide too much bulk for some users but not much at all  may add some weight as well but still  its minimal  with constant use  the color on the plastic interchangeable pieces may wear a bit but this isto be expected with the use of the case over time  depending on where your device has a film or some sort of user placed skin  the colored plastic interchangeablepieces may not fit 100  seamlessly on the sides  i have to not have a film but they havecaused other cases including new trent cases to not fit 100  as intended by the manufacturer this is a user preference and not the fault of the oem so  i see this case as a great addition to my outdoor activities as well as feeling secureallowing my 2yo and 5yo to play with it or walk around outdoors with it  traveling is a goodidea with this as you never know when you may drop the device due to unforeseen circumstancesor areas you are not used to walking  running etc   that's my opinion of this device  its a 5 star device in my book  
this was a good product and fit well on my phone it grips it well and the stand is also great for the phone
it's a little hard to apply if you are not used to do a wet application but after it dries out it looks fantastic it has the same feel as the zagg product and also comes with lifetime warranty 
it is very nice one   just perfect on my new cell phone  i like it alottt  thank you   have a a nice day 
this mount is really handy and easy to use   i had a problem getting it to stick on my dash at first  but got it to stick and stay eventually  you have to use the pad that comes with the mount because it will not secure itself to anything with out it   i like how it is adjustable so that other phones can use it as well and that it can rotate so that you can view it in landscape mode as well   it would be nice if they would have built the charging system in to the unit  but it i suppose it would be less universal   overall this is a very nice product but a little on the pricey side 
i really like these  they fit snug and look great and work great  the only flaw is that they are thinner then i expected so they don't exactly keep you warm  however  overall i like them and i would plan to purchase them again 
this case if very cute and protective  but it's no where near the quality of the otterbox  the plastic has very sharp edges  makes it uncomfortable to hold  and the built in screen protector was a little hazy and came with marks on it already  i already had a screen protector on my phone so i just popped the one built into the case out and it worked a lot better  i kept this case on my phone for 2 days  i couldn't take the plastic poking my fingers so i took it off i really wanted to love this case  but if i get this style of case again  i'll stick with otterbox 
i like the fitted fit of the case and the colors are nice  it's great to change up the look of my phone so it's not so boring 
i used to love this bluetooth headset  i used it for about two years  and loved how quick it was to answer calls by just flipping it open  i also like that you can easily switch it from right ear to left ear by just pulling the hook off the buttons on this device are easy to access  and it was comfortable enough to use for extended periods of time however  overtime  the static on the calls just got worse and worse until i could no longer use this without people getting really annoyed  i don't know if maybe i dropped it too many times  or if moisture got into it  but after working well for about a year and a half  i had to retire this device  i now use the h730 motorola h730  bulk packaged even at its best  people could still tell that i was using a bluetooth when speaking with this device  since upgrading to the h730  i have not had a single person ask if i was using a bluetooth  i think the placement of the microphone hole on the newer version may have some impact on that  as it is away from your face more on the newer version  compared with being on the actual flip open boom piece that rests on your cheek  for these reasons  i only gave this bluetooth 3 stars  and would recommend the h730 instead 
i thought that this was going to be another cheap charger  but i was wrong   it has a nice weight to it  and a long cord   i'm very surprised at how fast it charges   when my lights went out doing the ice storm  i was upset because my phone was dead  then i remembered my car charger   my daugter and i charged up our phones in about an hour  love it 
this charger works  feels and looks just as described  i recommend it since it is just a fraction of the cost of those at the phone stores 
love it  it does everything i need   i use it for emergencies  i don't feel alone  when i need to run errans  certainly great for the money  
i bought this to replace the battery on my samsung galaxy s3 which wouldn't last more than a couple hours anymore  i followed the instructions included which said to drain it totally and fully charge it a couple time before normal use  my battery will last around 16 24 hours now depending on use  the only problem i've encountered is it doesn't seem to like to charge on the charger that came with the phone  i have a generic spare charger that works fine with this battery though  not sure if this is the product or just my phone as it is almost 2 years old now and the charging port isn't the best anymore  we will probably be buying another one for husbands phone in a couple months 
i liked it ok but prefer the ones that have rubber then the back snaps on  the plastic is easy to break
a good sturdy tpu case with perfect cutouts  no buttons are hard to push  the product has a tight fit and definitely won't slide off unless you try hard to pry it off  awesome case that i used on my nexus  now that the wife has it  she loves the case too  great deal 
these are great screen protectors for the lg dare and much much cheaper than the ones verizon used to sell   verizon sold 3 for  10  and i bought these 3 for  3   awesome    
my brother loved this item  was able to use it all the time  did get alot of use out of it  and leater looks good  more expensive looking than what i paid for it 
thanks again fast great and reliable  love so so so so so so so so so so so so much
this is a much  much better headset than the old hs500  this has the bt 2 0 standard  it delivers better range  aka more than ten feet   great sound quality and works with more devices than anything i've seen in a similar price range  the battery life is great too its downsides are the multifunction button that is way to easy to press  and the fact that it does not have the ability to filter out non voice sounds 
i am disappointed in this item because it is pretty in the picture but is very thn and  the picture is much sturdier looking than the item
it arrived on time an was as described well  it fits well and the phone does not slip out  thanks
i gave it 1 star because the color is nice   functionality wise     nahhhh  there's some phone functions u cant access because the cover gets in the way and its bulky  so bought a different one 
i purchased this for my nieces and she absolutely loves this   they get a lot of compliments on these all of the time 
too cute to nit use  it's bling on hk  what else is there to say  get one  or two   give one as a gift  in the spirit of the kitty
this package was very nice     love the colors and durability     love the purple one the most   i would recommend to others    
the case was a big hit with my daughter she loved it  it was easy to install on the phone as well 
i'm a big fan of these cheap with free shipping cases  the only reason i don't give this one 5 stars is because the having the phone in your purse or pocket stains the orange and it loses its color   if i ordered another one i'd pick a darker color   otherwise it's a solid case  just be aware that it ships from china so it will take a while to get to you   but otherwise great deal for the money 
just what i was looking for as far as getting the most for my dollar  instead of getting the most cost for shipping it  great service as well 
good charger but does not last long  after a couple of months the light that would come on when a batter is placed in it started to light dimly 
this has to be the best phone case i've ever owned  works great with my wireless charging as well  dropped my phone a few times already with no problems what so ever 
i ordered this just to have a backup cover for when my current cover dies and am now using it as my primary cover and my original one is now in a drawer as a backup pros   inexpensive  inexpensive enough that you can oorder a few to get the colour combo you want   2 layers offer extra protection  silicone fully covers the phone and the hard plastic then covers the silicone for extra protection  silicone offers better grip and cushions impact  hard plastic exo skeleton offers extra direct impact protection   hard plastic exo skeleton has a soft but smooth finish that is not sticky so it will slide smoothly into pockets and purses but is still grippy enough to hold  strategically cut holes in the exo skeleton allows the silicone inner case to show for both design purposes and for extra grip  overall the entire case  inner   outer cases are slim by themselves and together  the iphone 5's slim profile is still maintained overall a very pleasant surprise and recommended 
really like this case  it's super cute  was a bit dissapointed when first received it because by the description i thought it was hard cover and it turned out to be a rubber case  the case is really nice and would purchase similar one again 
purple  snug fit   it has a nice grip on the outside to keep me from dropping my phone   this is great 
there is a reason this item is cheap   i would love to give you specific details  but the truth of the matter is that this will sum up the entire situation   it's cheap 
had a very bad smell 
i've always been skeptical with aftermarket chinese electronics  but they really did a good job with this one   the fit finish is also excellent  and it appears they used good plastics for a change   however  there's usually some big issue with these imports  usually some big functional design screw up that renders the unit worthless   but this thing does work  see below  first off  it comes with a 1 5amp charger   finally somebody in china figured out that the note uses a 2amp charging circuit   most other cheap charging units use 500ma chargers   5amp  they have laying around on the shelves by the millions   anything less than 2 0 amps means a long charge cycle   but 1 5 will do  at least they're thinking   anyway  i just hooked it into the 2 0 amp charger that came w the note2   so now in the stand  it charges about as fast as when not using this device but alas   and here's the screw up   the 2cd battery charger has a circuit that limits it's charge rate to 350ma   here's what i've found out   the primary slot will charge at 1 8amps   full is 2 0 amps   the secondary slot will charge at 350ma     so why did the chinese limit the charge rates on this unit's circuit board   there's always a reason  but they never have a work around   i'm guessing this unit was made for another phone and was retrofitted for the note2   they didn't have time to redesign a new circuit board  but did have time to refit the holder slots  so here ya go if you can live with charge times about 10  less in the primary charger  you won't be able to tell the difference   and about 80  less in the 2cd battery slot  then this is your solution   for me  it's just fine i have 3x extra note2 batteries  they're cheap   you can find a 3500ma aftermarket battery for about  10ea out here on amazon   i usually just take the dead battery out of the phone  stick it into the slot  and put a fresh one in the phone   and i'm off   the old battery will charge in about 12 hours because of the limitations of this unit  but that's fine with me now  if i really need a quick charge  i just put the phone in the first slot  and it'll be fully charged in about an hour or so   sometimes i leave it in all night   the phone won't let itself overcharge bottom line   i'd buy it again   in fact i did   i bought one for the wife   it's also about the best one on the market i've seen   even on ebay   i use the samsung flip case on my note2  and it fits just fine   you can even open the cover while it's in the slot the 4 stars is because this is a retrofit from another phone design  and the 2cd slot will only charge at  15  the full rate   but it does charge eventually   also the little slip of chinese paper that comes with it are worthless instructions  so don't plan on curling up next to the fireplace for a good read   just plug it in and use it   and you can't beat the price
i took off the bow and chains as soon as i got it and it didnt ruin the case at all  looks much more elegant now  it is made of glitter so it tends to rub off a bit especially if u put it in ur pocket  not too much tho 
this device surprised me  i bought a cheap device that worked poorly and wanted something better  the bluetooth wonder satisfied my requirements for handset control  microphone that does not turn off the music  hands free operation  except for the multipurpose button to turn on the microphone works with my ipod and iphone also with sri and voice commands the only minus is the battery life  the manual says 3 hours  but it is more like 5 or 6  there are plenty of devices that have this same battery life  but those that have longer life are necessarily larger and come at a high price tag this unit is very small  with a lapel clip for easy access to the buttons i would recommend 
i really like this case  it is different in style yet really attractive  i chipped my first one so i ordered another  it's worth it 
did exactly what it was made to do  protect my phones screen from scratches and damages  i change mine about every 3months so i will def be buying these again 
my iphone was a piece of garbage both software and hardware wise with crashes  app crashes  terrible battery life  closed ios limitations  terrible connectivity  way to delicate if dropped or hit and worthless updates that further crippled the phone due to apple wanting you to buy a new one each year   i tried an iphone 4s and had the same exact problems as it was the exact same phone with a different shape slightly as is the new iphone 5 it seems lol   so as with my mac osx days i ditched apple for microsoft with a brand new  way faster and less limited pc and a new nokia lumia windows phone 7   i was amazed at how much faster  easier to use  reliable  better connectivity  better reception and much better windows phone 7 os was than the slow garbage i had been using   the design of this device even shines as the housing itself is solid and can take hard drops or hits easily without exploding like the iphone and the pictures are way better and even has  auto fix  for photo's   very happy and cannot wait for the nokia lumia 920 which has actual great improvement in both software and hardware designs unlike was apple iphone  mac or osx release   great job microsoft   this is the smartphone of the future and with the coming ms surface  ipad will be a dated childrens toy   oh and even siri when asked what is the best smartphone ever replied  nokia lumia 800   that was before of course apple patched it to say  there are other smartphones     lt     look it up it's fact   there you go great purchase  amazing phone   the next update windows phone 7 8 is comming soon so give these smartphones windows 8 functionality   so if you get either a lumia 800 or 820 or 900 you will have the best functionality and mobile os available weather it be windows 8 or 7 8 
i recently purchased this product after reading all reviews to pair with my new iphone 3gs  i wanted to use for listening to podcasts and music as well as the telephone functions  i was disappointed in the thin sound quality  the difficulty in getting a decent fit  the lack of a pause function for my podcasts and music and lastly the constant on and off performance during listening  i never used it away from my phone to make sure there were no distance issues   i had some difficulty in operating the sync  on and off functions and getting in and out of my car caused it to fight with my built in car bluetooth  the unit is light  inexpensive at 35 40 00 and has decent build quality  lack of a pause function is a deal breaker as well as the constant stopping and starting while listening to content  it was unusable so i had no choice and had to return to store  i wanted to like it because of the price and weight  i read the manual completely and am an experienced user of tech  phone function worked well 
as a water resistant case it gets 4 stars as a water proof case it gets 0 stars this is a descent case but it is not waterproof  this is a water resistant case only this is a great case for waiting at the bus stop while talking on the phone  then it starts raining  possibly this is a good case for when walking into a room full of steam  maybe even a good case for when someone accidentally spills coffee on your phone and you quickly clean it up  but  do not use this case for swimming  even in shallow water   do not try to demonstrate its capabilities on a real phone in front of your friends again  this is not a waterproof case this is a water resistant case instead i received this product in return for an honest review 
i was excited to receive berlkin car charger 1 amp 5 watts   white   being a family that is huge on ipods  as a mother  ipods have been a blessing while driving anywhere more than a short distance  they keep the kids entertained  allowing us to maintain our sanity  what's not good is when someone's ipod dies  thus the reason i was so excite to discover they have a charger for the car  i ordered two of a different model  one red  one blue  one for my vehicle and one for my husband's truck  now that we have this great little device  i don't want to be caught without it  since my daughter recently started driving  knowing the future held a third vehicle  i ordered the berlkin car charger 1 amp 5 watts   white for her vehicle  simply a must for each car we have product features  ultra compact plugs into any car power outlet 1 amp 5 watts lightning connector compatible with usb connection connected equipment warranty     ultra compact     plugs into any car power outlet     1 amp 5 watts     lightning connector compatible with usb connection     connected equipment warranty
this case is very nice  fits perfectly on my iphone 5s   really does look wet  i get a lot of compliments
i got this because in my job i am always on the move and no always i have a outlet or car charger nearby  awesome battery pack  i love it  i have charged like 10 times now  cant say how many times it can charges my iphone 5 but  if my phone is discharged fully  this batter juice fill it up like in 30 mins  yes that fast  it comes with 2 usb ports  one of them is 2v which charges faster than the other i would recomend this item and when my juice broke down  i would get the same one 
though the case appears  pretty   it has a mirror shine   it is super slippery  i have already dropped my phone twice while this cover was on it  and  it is crucial to note that this is merely a hard plastic case  the interior is somewhat softer  but there is still no cushion here   under no circumstances was i willing to continue using this case  between the lack of protection and the slipperiness of it  i can only foresee trouble   and  since i never buy the insurance plans for my phones  i cannot afford to have a cheap case   additionally  if you are a tidy person  know that this case shows every smudge  purchase with caution 
not exactly what i thought it was  looking at the picture  i thought it was white  but it is actually a clear case  in the end  it's okay 
the altec lansing imw555 blk offers a wireless bluetooth experience for a cheaper price than other brands out there  after using it for a couple weeks now  i can say i am satisfied with the performance but i kind of see where the gap between this and other brands may be out of the box  a very nice box  by the way   this altec speaker looks pretty nice  the design  while not of a very discreet size  is elegant and cool looking at the same time  one thing i really liked about it is the fact that it comes prepared in case you would like to mount it on a wall  horizontally or vertically   this i had not seen in a device like this so that was a welcomed feature  keep in mind this is a large device  well  larger than your average bluetooth speaker  it may not be as portable as one may expect in size  but it is very light and indeed very easy to carry pairing the device was a breeze  once i paired my iphone 5 with it  it is just a matter of turning the altec speaker on and it will pair automatically after the first pairing  i have used the mic a couple times i have received calls while using it and have had no problems whatsoever  the bluetooth button in the speaker also serves as play pause   which is nice if your phone is not near  battery life is great  i used it for over a week a couple hours in the afternoons before having to charge it one more time how does it sound  here is where i found the imw555 blk lacking  while the sound it produces is clear and there is no distortion is you raise the volume  the bass  or lack of  sound is simply not enough  i have a couple other speakers at home and compared to those  the sound in this one is  again  lacking  the tdk a33 for example  is a great bluetooth option that produces amazing sound indoors and outdoors  the  imw555 blk would be more of an indoor speaker  there is a difference in price once you compare the  imw555 blk with the a33 i brought as a example  but that difference is up to you if you consider yourself an audiophile  or if at least bass is important to you the  imw555 blk is an impressive device that performs quite well  except for the bass issue i mentioned above  i cannot see myself not recommending it  the bluetooth option in these type of speaker normally raises the price way too much  so having that for the price of the altec  imw555 blk is definitely a bargain 
good value for the price  the batteries seem to be holding up as well as original equipment samsung batteries  i would have liked a charger for each battery   but that's not a deal breaker 
i was interested in this unit because it's a little more economical than themophie juice pack   the form factor is a little larger than the mophie and i have the impression that the tylt isn't quite as well designed   haven't said that  the tylt is still pretty nice   the mophie has a four light power status light while the tylt only has one light with multiple colors   the mini usb charging port is well integrated on the mophie but sticks out the bottom of the tylt  which makes it look like an after thought   i prefer the slightly grippy texture of the mophie over the smooth tylt   for me  i think i'd still spend the extra money for the mophie but the tylt is still a pretty nice charging case 
bought this verizon original car charger and was very satisfied because after a year is still going strong and works on many android phones 
i got this case through vine  so i didn't have to suffer the price of it  but i do believe the price i see for it to be out of line   it is a nice enough case   it looks fine   it is designed to be waterproof and it passed the water test i put it through   so  it should be a good case to use for outdoor or any activities where your phone might otherwise get wet   i like to kayak  so it should do well with my phone in my pocket in this case   i also very much like the fact that you can attach a lanyard strap to the case   that feature has been a phone saver for me many times and it's not that common but  why should this case cost over  70   based on its look  feel  construction  etc   i would've guessed a price of certainly under  50 and maybe under  40   i think one of its big competitors  otterbox  offers a lower cost option that looks more substantial to me   i guess if you like this case's look and features and don't mind the price  it should be ok   it just doesn't look like good value to me 
update   i wrote the review below  a few days ago after my first use  and gave it 5 stars initially   now i have reduced it to 1  because after one use  it will not charge   i plugged it into the solar charger that is pimped with it  and it would not charge   the indicator light blinks  but it will not charge at all   i then plugged it in using the mini usb charger i used when i first received it   did the same thing   light blinks  but no charge   tried another mini usb charger  same result   now  i'm very disturbed that amazon won't take it back because i've had it longer than 30 days  so now i have to deal with a company that operates out of china   i just had to write them  easyacc  on their website  and i am waiting for their reply  i wanted to have battery backup for a camping trip this weekend   now i have to go without   very disappointed    original review  i charged this when i first got it 2 5 months ago   it has been sitting in it's case  that i bought along with it and the solar charger  ever since i decided to finally pull it out and see what i could get out of it   i turned it on  and all 4 four bars lit up  showing it was still charge enough to show 4 bars   i first plugged my powered off kindle fire hd 7 inch to it   my kindle was down to 7   and fully charged to 100  after about 5 hours   the easyacc was down to 2 bars of power left in it   the kindle battery is approximately 4000mah  so if the easyacc used around 5000mah to charge it  that's seem pretty good to me next i plugged my htc one s  which is 1650mah   note   i was down to 10  and charged it while the phone was still powered on  it took a couple hours to charge back to 100   with the phone on   the easyacc was down to 1 power bar lit two days later  i plugged my phone into it again  and charge it from 12  to 100   while powered on   still 1 power bar lit on the easyacc after 2 more days  i plugged my phone into it again at 7   while power on   after about 20 minutes  i noticed the last power bar left on the easyacc  was flashing  telling me that it was about to run out of power   it finally shut down after getting my phone up to 28  i'm not a techie  but i'd estimate that my phone battery charged for a total of 3300mah  off the easacc that was down to approximately 5000mah   also  remember my phone was also on  and i did unplug it a couple times to answer calls during the charging process  and then plugged it back in   i'm thinking if i use it just for my htc phone  i should be able to get between 5 and 6 charges out of it i'm very happy with how my 10000mah easyacc power bank pack performed  especially after sitting for 2 5 months in between the first charge  and actually using it   i will be hooking it up to the easyacc solar charger to see how well it charges so i can gauge how it will perform on my camping trips to charge my phone and camera batteries 
just got it yesterday i like the looks and it like i said it if it would have more room for cards so that it will close
i've used these mostly for computer listening  but my mother has borrowed them periodically for both skype and with her phone we both agree that the sound is great and the comfort fit is solid my ears are ridiculously sensitive to pressure in any form and i have a significant hearing impairment in one ear  as a result i'm super super picky about what i use if you're in the market for a reasonably priced set of headphones for computer use or even phone use  then these are great  i wish they were also versatile enough for exercise  but i know they'd fall out of my sweaty ears and the cord is too short 
the industrial look  precision mold  and materials  is making this case the best of the bunch for the s3  i love the look and color of this case  i've constantly kept a lookout for an s3 case and finally found the one i wanted to buy  immediately   it feels thinner than it looks  and has great protection considering its lightweight material  my previous temporary case is now finally retired 
to start out with  i always have trouble with every phone i get   i don't know if it's me or if i always have bad luck with phones i have had a blackberry torch 9810 and before that i had an iphone 3g and my last phone was another iphone 3g and i have to admit that they were all jokes   when i had my iphone 3g i dropped it 2 feet above the ground and it completely broke and would cost me alot to fix it   i just recieved my samsung infuse 4g on january 7  2013   i know it's probably to early to make a review about it because i only have had it for a day and i admit i was very worried that i would recieve a lemon or something would be wrong with it   i was wrong  i was so excited when i got it   it was in immaculate condition  there wasn't a scratch on it anywhere   there was a brand new black casemate and screen protector on it   i was shocked how amazing it looked and to top it off i bought it used like new for only  130 00   it was so light that i thought it didn't have a battery in it   it's screen is 1 2 of an inch bigger than the iphone 5   the samsung infuse 4g has a massive 4 5 inch touchscreen and the iphone 5 has only a 4 inch screen   the iphone 3g  4 and 4s only has a 3 5 inch screen   i know your probably thinking that a half of an inch is nothing but when you do the comparison it's a big deal   the camera is an amazing 8mp with a front facing camera of 1 3mp and the iphone 4 and 4s is only a 5mp with a 1mp front camera and the iphone 3g is only a 2mp with no front camera   the camera on the samsung infuse is touch to focus and takes stunning pictures   the screen is hd and stunning color and amazing sound also super fast   i could brag about this phone all day   i couldn't find one thing wrong with this phone and that's rare for me because i'm very judgemental when it comes to cell phones   the iphone is nothing compared to the samsung infuse   if the iphone battery stops holding a charge it costs an arm and a leg to have a new one put in and alot of time but if the samsung infuses' battery won't hold a charge i can buy one for  14 00 and do it myself in 5 seconds   although i am going to buy a new case for it because i love the otterbox defender series case because it's a 3 in 1 protection  first is the hard plastic layer  2nd is rubber layer over the plastic than the 3rd is a built in screen protector wich is better than a regular screen protector than to top it off it comes with a holster clip   i give the samsung infuse 4g a 5 out of 5 stars 2 thumbs up and hghly recommend   don't make another mistake like i did by buying an iphone just because of the name   i will never regret getting the samsung infuse 4g 
i have a hard time giving this item more stars   it does what it says and works well  but the price is a total bummer 
just the right case for me  drop my phone all the time falls out of shirt pocket two or three times a day now it can take all bumps i can give it 
the only reason i didn't give it a 5 is because its still fairly new  but so far i have no issues  it automatically goes to speaker when on the base so you can answer it that way  that was a nice surprise  love that i can charge extra battery and phone at same time 
this case case very well thought out  it has a stylish design that compliments the s5 very well the bezel on the front is high enough to provide some protection to the screen should it fall the rubberized sides make it easy to grip and help to make sure your phone doesn't fall out of your pocket the back of the case does a nice job blending the camera into the phone  another nice feature is that the back has just enough clearance when you set the phone down to let the rear speaker play without getting muffled 
this case is the best i've purchased for a cell phone  i've had over 15 different phones over the years   i've purchased leather cases for most of them  this one is number one  very highly recommend this case 
excellent case  and workmanship  plus the case doesnt add much bulk to the very slim note3 gets lots of compliments 
the cutout for the bottom connector is too small and the hard plastic makes the volume and power button very hard to press  this is how to fix it i liked the look of this bumper and at the low price it was worth a gamble the unit has serious issues which leads me to believe that this unit was designed in a cad program and was never actually prototyped and tested before they went into production first the cutout on the bottom is too small for the apple sync charge connector  you have to pull the bumper off to fit it or use my   34 fix  34  described below the second problem is that the volume buttons are very hard to press  same with the power on off button on the top  so hard that in my opinion they are unusable as shipped the solution is as follows  use an x acto knife or a dremel tool to enlarge the holes  you can also make the buttons easier to press by making cuts around the buttons  weakening the material  until you get a pressure you are comfortable with personally  i never found a comfortable pressure level so i ended up completely cutting out both buttons  this leaves the original iphone controls exposed but inset  it works fine for me but if you have large fingers or long fingernails  you may have difficulty pressing the buttons i did this because i already had the unit and have the tools  the plastic is fairly tough so you do need a sharp knife and a fair amount of steady pressure to cut   if you aren't a handy person or don't have the tools  i would recommend avoiding this poorly designed product 
our daughter needs a plug to keep her kindle fire charged in the back when playing battery draining games like minecraft  watching movies or  gasp  reading  my wife needs a plug to keep her phone charged in the front on long road trips  or even around town   our car only has one 12v socket in the dashboard not a problem  this charger solves that problem perfectly  although it says   34 apple  34  and   34 android  34  on the plugs  you can use either for either there is no led to let you know it's got power  so be aware of that be aware that this adapter doesn't include cables  it is just the adapter  be sure to order your correct cables separately  i ordered the mediabridge usb 2 0 high speed cables for our android phones and tablets  but any cable that's long enough will work  their 6 foot cable works perfectly to provide a power cable to the back seat from the front seat plug  without having to be pulled tight 
this was good while it lasted  but it was pretty fragile  both of the 30 pin ends broke off within a couple of months 
these screen protectors are the best performing ones in 15 years  highly recommended  clear view and strong     thank you 
i got these thinking all ipod cable were the same  or as good    wrong  one of the plugs separated from the housing as i was unplugging it  so i had to use super glue to hold it together   my hyundai sonata only recognizes my itouch about half the time when i use the short cable  which is a shame  because the cable is exactly the right length  my pc doesn't have an issue with any of them 
its really hard getting the phone out of these dock which is annoying the crap out of me    something as simple as trying to lift a phone off a dock shouldn't require so much effort  hardly worth the purchase in my opinion 
great product and great price
i prefer the plantronics voyager pro line for better noise isolation and more comfortable fit what's nice about this lg is the dedicated sliding on off switch  and the durability  i can throw it in my pocket or briefcase and not worry about it  so it serves as my backup headset  but others that move the mic closer to your mouth pick up better sound the ear loop on this is a torture device  i use it without the removable loop and just jam it in my ear canal like an earbud  which also hurts after a while   
this is hands down the best bluetooth headset i've ever owned  and i've owned a dozen or so over the years   the earpiece is loud enough for use in a car at 75mph   the mic picks up your voice very well and everyone i talk with reports not being able to tell that i'm on a headset   the battery lasts all day  even with an hour and a half or two worth of active talk time   now for the downsides  it's still a bluetooth headset  so sound quality isn't perfect  it's much bulkier and more awkward than other headsets  it's damn expensive   do yourself a favor and buy this one if you have to have a bluetooth headset for use in the car or around the office  but know that it's not perfect and there will still be frustrations   it's the best  by far  of a bad bunch 
first  other reviewers said it took them an hour to figure out install the device  and there were reports of phones overheating while in the parrot device  too snug couldn't breathe   i found neither of those things to be a problem that said  my recommendation would be limited  and based on the type of phone you have  i have a blackberry pearl  and just switched to a samsung epic  the parrot minikit did almost nothing for me   i would not recommend if you have these phones and here's why the theory behind this device is  mount it on dash  then use all your phone features plus turn your phone into a mounted gps it says it will fit any phone   it did fit the pearl just fine  but the samsung epic  with case  was too big  i have to take my protective glove off the epic each time i want to mount it  that in itself is a deal killer for me also  the speakerphone   voice commands for both the blackberry and the samsung epic work as good  or better  than the parrot minikit  even with the convertible top down  my devices understand my voice commands  they don't really need amplification  and i don't really need the parrot to relay my commands or act as speakerphone  and the microphone cord on the parrot minikit is somewhat convoluted  a dangling wire   so i'm at a loss as to how the parrot minikit helps me so i didn't really benefit from syncing my samsung epic  and it didn't work with the blackberry anyway  on the samsung epic  any android phone  really  the google voice command functions work fine on their own  even if you don't have a great speakerphone  any bluetooth hands free works great if you already have audible instructions or gps on your phone  so again  the need for this device is limited i did enjoy having my phone mounted like a gps  but didn't really use it that way  since google reads directions to me on my samsung epic  so i don't really need to see it  so even though the parrot minikit does have an impressive range of features  just a plain plastic mount  without the hands free or sync features  would work just as well for me i can imagine this would work well for someone who needs to use gps on their phone  needs it mounted  needs a loud amplified voice reading them directions  does not have a large smartphone  does not have a blackberry  and has a weak speaker or microphone on their phone 
such a handy device to use with my phone   my kindle fire  and my ipad   extremely economical and very sturdy 
do not waste money on this piece of junk   not even worth a buck  no protection at all  none 
basic screen protector specific to the htc inspire  it comes with 3 covers  but i don't know that the price matches the product  i would think this would be much less expensive also comes with a cleaning cloth and a card to smooth out the bubbles  maybe that's why the price is high 
update   after a 7 5 hour drive in a large and noisy delivery truck  i've upped my rating   even though the cab was super noisy and could barely hear the truck radio  the person i called could hear me clearly and i had no problem hearing them   the earbuds do a nice job of blocking out sound   the person on the other end of the call heard very little of the cab noise  normally they can barely hear me    sound quality while streaming slacker radio and play music through my phone was clear  but lacking bass   streaming the same apps through my tablet have excellent bass  think it's time for a new phone       i did not recharge the headset before my trip  but after using the headset all day long and the hour or two last night  i'm still at medium charge   i was streaming music the whole trip and made received 15 or so phone calls the only tests left for me are durability and longevity   but as of right now i am very happy with my purchase if you want different colors  verizon sells a red black model and a white  best buy sells a blue black model  verizon also has a sale on these at the moment    the red black headset looked really sharp  but i went with boring ole black since i'll be wearing these at work often original post i just received these today  but have been using them for a few hours now   sound quality is pretty good  better than any other bluetooth headset i've had   there is very noticeable lag when watching netflix videos i can walk two rooms away from my phone as retain signal as long as i face the  left side of my head toward where the phone is sitting  if i face the right side to the phone tablet the signal starts cutting out   i made a test call to my wife  she could hear me fine  sound quality wasn't too different than using my phones mic   haven't tried calling from a moving car yet though i did experience some odd cutting out while sitting with my phone next to me a couple times   also these are very loud while using them with my phone  i have the volume set to the lowest setting and they are still borderline too loud while playing music   the volume works fine with my tablet though for the price i feel the range should be longer or there should be a receiver on each side of the headset   i'll toss up an update once i've used these for a week or so   would be nice to be able to pair it up with more than two devices as well    computer and ps3 would also be nice   not just phone and tablet the phone i'm currently using them with is a driod razr maxx   they also work very well with my sony xperia tablet s
i absolutely love this case  it holds your id and a couple debit or credit cards  it also has a place for money so sometimes i am actually able to avoid carrying a purse
the case fit well  there's plenty of room for inputs  and good button overlays   the window in the cover seems pretty cool however  once i used it i found that the flap was always in my way  and i pretty quickly shifted to a different case   it's probably a preference issue  but i honestly found i didn't want to have to deal with a cover  however  i have no other major complains so if you're sure you want a folio case then this one may work well for you 
this case is exactly what is says it is and fits perfectly  i've had it since november 2013 and it has not broken  scratched  or become loose  keep this case clean though  once it gets dirty there is no going back  i've tried cleaning it with soap  water  and a sponge and it is still dingy from dust on desks and tables 
i like this product   i like this type of product in general  i have reviewed many of these power supplies    this one is great  in terms of charging functions and use   however  the rubber shield that protects the connectors is loose fitting and gets in the way   still  the device does work well and seems durable 
i loved using this because i like the feel of a real keyboard  i wish the buttons were a little bigger but still worked nicely
i used this case for awhile and dropped it so many times  i finally broke it in the corner and had to replace it  the only thing i can say about it that is bad is that it isn't as purple as it looks in the pic  great case though 
does what you expect   covers everything you want to protect and keeps open ports that you'll need only a couple complaints   the stand could be better and have different levels of heigh control   currently on slides out a bit too far   the rubber at the bottom of the case  where the power port is  seems to be bending   im just waiting for it to tear overall i like the case and would buy it again 
this work awesome on the iphone 5 and keep a great protection again anything  thank you for the fast shipment and great product 
i have not used or owned this product for an extensive amount of time yet  but so far it seems to work well  i think it was a pretty good buy  it was a little bit bulkier than i thought  but it is not overbearingly large at all  even the little red light works  so that is a plus  i thought it would be cheap and not actually work  i would recommend this product 
the images on this shell case clearly show the case fitting into the holster with the phone facing outward   so you can watch a movie without having to hold your phone  but i ordered three of them and the case is not reversible and because it can't be put into the holster facing outward  the kickstand is totally useless 
i love it and can't wait to use it because it is different from others i saw everyone using   i am glad i will be the first to use this 
instantly connects to my phone after downloading appropriate apps on my android 4 0  pretty good battery and can control music and view text and calls with out looking at phone  plus the time lol 
this is a nice sleek slim case and i'm very somewhat happy with it   i like the textured grip around the edges so i never feel like the phone is going to slip out of my hands  one complaint is the volume buttons are pretty difficult to press with this case on but i've kind of gotten used to it update  after using this case for about 2 weeks  it has discolored around the edges to a brownish yellow   i wish i could return it   i recommend spending a bit more and getting a case that won't turn colors so quickly   bummer 
this is one of my favorite colors and i haven't seen a lot of choices in this color so i love it and its texture 
i like how this cord looks   yes  i know that's not the important part  but it does look cool   the blue and yellow pop and the metal is gold   i love it now  does it work   yes   it's strong and durable   i use it for my kindle fire hd since my son destroyed my original cable in his backpack   it doesn't get twisted up like plastic cable  or knotted it's a nice length at six feet   long enough to read the kindle in bed while charging  but short enough that it's not dragging everywhere in the way only bummer is it is not compatible with my iphone  
i want my money back didn't charge my ipad air
this case is comprised of 2 pieces  including a soft silicone case and a hard polycarbonate shell which snugly sits on top  it adds a small lip to the screen side  which will protect the screen from falls  together the covers are very protective  and dropping the phone from a pocket won't damage the phone at all under normal circumstances i bought this for my sgh i777 but then i got an extended battery and it no longer fits  the sgh i777 will only run for about 10 hours on the stock battery  medium use   so most users will want an extended battery  i didn't want to return the case though  as it was so inexpensive compared with others i looked at 
very impressed on how fast i got this case  i literally got in less than a day  how about that    and its nice too    love the colors too
despite appearances  these jabra sport corded headphones are not an in ear earplug design  but rather small outside the ear headphones with large bendable earhooks to help them stay put during active use  an upmarket take on a form that's usually been taken only by cheap sports  headphones   it's an interesting form factor  with distinct advantages and disadvantages in use  with any of the included eargels and any shape bent into the hooks  these jabras stay well outside the ear canal   this is a deliberate design feature  since it allows a lot of environmental noise in    helping users stay safe while running near traffic  for instance    but it also has some bad consequences for the sound   the headphones are very weak in the bass and lower midrange  not producing much richness of tone even for non bass heavy music  and they're pretty much unacceptable for hip hop even with heavy eq bass boosting    in any use  they need to be driven very loud  near the top of the volume range  for acceptable sound  cutting down on battery life and headroom   the sound tends toward tinny treble heaviness  but is otherwise pleasant  still  at this price point  there are a host of far better choices for serious music listening the nifty form factor is what makes these jabra headphones worth considering for active users  despite their average at best sound quality   their distinctive wide  rubbery  yellow cable is excellent  the best i've seen on any set of portable earphones for resisting tangling  and includes a useful  moveable clip as well as a phone compatible mic remote    but the in line volume control is useless  considering how loudly they need to be driven in order to be audible at all  every user will have to leave it at maximum    the earphones themselves have massive  rubbery silicone ear hooks  which can be bent into a shape that keeps them in place even if you're moving around a lot    a great design for exercise   the downside is that the ear hooks are so clunky and fat that they are very hard to fit with glasses    worn with glasses  they tend to come unhooked easily  or to end up in uncomfortable positions tl dr  in short  these headphones are pretty good for   use while exercising outdoors  preserving the ability to hear your surroundings  resisting cable tanglingbut do not even consider buying these if   you wear glasses  you like very loud or bass heavy music  you want rich  deep sound for music listening in a quiet environment  you want to be isolated from environmental noiserecommended only for heavy outdoor exercise use  for any other use  you can get much better sound for the money with a different set of headphones for great quiet listening sound in an outside the ear headphone  try some largergradocans instead  for a portable set of noise isolating earphones with excellent sound  consider in ear models fromklipschorshure   none of these is directly comparable to these jabras' oddball exercise friendly form factor  of course    but as a result they're also free of the compromises that the form imposes on the jabras' sound quality   and users who want ear hooks for active use but don't care much about sound might also want to try acheaper setofsports earphonesbefore deciding to spend this much on workout only headphones 
this is cheaper on amazon then on the spigen website   got this for my oldest stepson  the low profile design is great  i would recommend buying a screen protector if your afraid of scratching the front glass 
i've been a long time fan of the plantronics voyager pro series so naturally i was excited to grab an hd edition  looking nearly identical to my non hd earpiece i knew my way around it pretty quickly  i have an iphone so i knew to make it available for pairing by holding the power switch located at the bottom of the thick piece that fits behind your ear until it flashes an alternate red and blue  that puts it in discovery mode  the phone found it in seconds  the first person i called was my roommate and weirdly enough he sounded kind of distorted like he was screaming  i called a relative expecting the distorted sound and what i got was crystal clear amazing volume and clarity  turns out  my roommate's phone connection suks but we never noticed it because the high def totally did what hd does for tv   exposes all the flaws  it's crazy   i love this earpiece  they give you several ways to make the transmitter fit comfortable in your ear but i didn't need any adjustments  i wear mine all day without fatigue  way to go plantronics 
this case is awesome but has one minor flaw   there are sometimes watermarks or bubbles under the screen   good news is that it very easy to fix you can use almost anything to clean the screen of the otterbox and iphone screen then use a blow dryer on a low setting dry off both the otterbox screen and the iphone screen   keep the blow dryer about 12  away from each and it doesn't get very hot at all   do this for a minute or so then when you put the otterbox case together there will no no bubbles at all i used windex to clean my iphone and otterbox screen   worked perfectly on both phones i tried it on 
you cannot beat the price of this item  but it takes like what seems forever to get to you  i didn't know that i was ordering rom hong kong  which is the reason for the time factor   ha i known that  i would've never ordered it 
works fast and efficiently   i am pleased that this phone charger is so easy to plug in   i really like it 
not only did this arrive days earlier than expected  it fits like a dream  it's low profile but still offers the protection i need  i bought a white case  the same color as my samsung galaxy siii  and it's hard to tell there's a case on at all 
wow  this is a wonderful stylus for the price  i've bought styli in the past and easily spent over ten dollars for ones that the tip quickly falls off or the body is constructed of lightweight plastic this stylus has a nicely finished metal body with a great microfiber tip  it has worked well with my galaxy tablet and smartphone without any issues  it has a built in pen with a fine line black tip the stylus comes packaged in a black presentation box with a 'silky' lining  it would make a nice present i was provided a sample for evaluation and review 
well  you get what you pay for  i own a few oem htc batteries because the htc rezound is a major battery hog  so having a spare ready to go is a must this charger will not fully charge it to 100  i've tested it many times  you will notice one bar missing on the battery level display all the batteries i've charged with this only charge it up to 85  however  if i charge my phone with the usb  it will fully charge the battery to 100   it is definitely an issue with the charger and not the batteries 85  charged battery is better than nothing  but just keep in mind  you get what you pay for  the charging rate for this charger is also much slower than if you were to charge via usb directly with your phone there's a large bright led   it will be lit blue when you put it on the socket without a battery mounted  when it is charging  it will turn red  when it is  fully   more like 85  charged  charged  it will turn blue again i really wish there was a reliable fully chargeable separate battery charger for the rezound batteries  but these seem to be the only ones on the market 
i've been using it like 6 7 months now  and it's perfect  it's very very good quality  it looks awesome in my black iphone 5  i recommend it
i have been using the spen devices ever since the first note came out  usually with the use of the spen  the screen protector shows marks and signs of   34 pen tracks  34   with this screen protector  i haven't seen any  and i use the spen a lot another really good thing about this screen protector is the simplicity of installation  i know they all have the same general method  but this one doesn't require the use of any liquids  also the cloth used to clean the dust is large enough so you can get the dust off and then cover the screen until you have the screen protector ready to install and it minimizes the dust under the protector which makes it look better and last longer 
great for looks  but the case is to big for the phone which causes the phone to slide while in the case
i love these chargers with two usb ports  it lights up when you plug it in so you know powers getting to it  and it effortlessly chargers two usb devices 
i am very careful with my iphone   my best friend's iphone looks like it's been through the war so i know you need to be careful with these delicate instruments  i have a very nice case  thank you amazon  and i bought a glossy cover when i picked up my phone  it lasted a few months but was getting scratched and was always smudged with finger prints  i updated it when this arrived and i'm glad i did  the phone's functions work perfectly  as before  and now  i don't have finger print issues i'm guessing that the goth tech on ncis could get a fingerprint from this new cover but i can't see any and that's exactly the point installation was simple enough but it is a little fussy if you want to completely eliminate bubbles  i wanted to give 5 stars but took a 1 2 star back because the screen cleaner isn't as good as the eyeglasses lens cleaner i had handy and it seemed to work better than the belkin provided cloth do you need a cover  only you can decide  if you think you do  this is a good  typical belkin quality  meaning good  product 
once again this is the second time i have purchased an otterbox on amazon and received a counterfeit   this came in what appears to be oem packaging but the rubber was soft and squishy   just to double check upon receipt and examination of this product i was suspicious and ran down to local walmart and checked their same case out   guess what  the rubber on the walmart otter box  same product  was completely different   it was firm and held the case together   do yourself the favor and purchase from bestbuy or walmart   stay away         
at first i got this case to have as a meanwhile case while i waited on some other   34 better  34  cases but this case is amazing  doesnt feel cheap at all and fits snug and protect the screen with the bit of border it has along the top of the phone  great case if you dont want to spend  15 to  30 on cases  like i did  this case is amazing and not bad for the price 
i love my samsung bluetooth even if it comes with cheap ear hooks  i love the color  and it will not drained right away  battery is at good stand by time   
i really like the case  i thought it would be a softer plastic almost rubber case but it's a hard plastic one  either way the case looks great and i really like how it looks  i bought it for my bf and he likes it 
considering the fast i still have my back screen protector on since i bought this this thus far may be the best product
it came today and it doesn't have the apple logo showing and it already had finger prints  doesn't fit well trust me      don't buy          0 out of 5
no problems with this charger 
super fast delivery  terrific cover
excellent  this product is lovely and is very good for use in my new iphone 4 s and others thing to me
an elegant silver pen stylus   the pen is a fine point with smooth flowing ink that writes more like a fancy  fountain pen  than a bic the stylus end works well on my galaxy nexus  tapping with the stylus is picked up as well as my finger   if you haven't used a stylus on a touchscreen before  it makes precision tapping easier  especially for those of you with big clumsy fingers   keeps grease and fingerprints off the screen  and makes it easier to point things out to others without your hand blocking what you're trying to show   i was given this product to review  i received no other compensation  and my review is my honest opinion of the product   this stylus has a bit of heft  and with its smoothly polished metal surface  is the sort of accessory that would look nice in a leather messenger bag   recommended 
fits perfectly    and is easy to install too   you have to love the boost of confidence  knowing that your phone is protected   waterproof to 6 6 feet   make sure to take your time and install it right    there is a video i found to be helpful  just search for armour shell installation 
case is quite slim  not adding extra bulk or weight  fits all corners like a glove i like how tightly it hugs the device  cut outs are perfect  love the separation between power button   volume toggle aside from shiny stock android symbols  the case has nice soft smooth finish  it doesn't seem to attract any smudges or dusts no wireless charging issues with panasonic qe tm101 wireless qi charger it was worth the money   wait  highly recommended for any 2013 nexus 7 owners   it also came with nice adjustable kickstand 
it took a really long time of browsing to find something that will hold a big phone  i have a galaxy s4 with an extended battery and for the longest time  i couldn't find a stand for it that could hold it without breaking  it may be a bit awkward to have the phone plugged in while upright on the stand  so just something to be mindful of  it doesn't bother me  i'm just elated to finally find this stand 
it's a great idea and the holder seemed to be made quite well  it even came with extra grip pads but you have to make sure your dash can handle it above my cd slot the dash protrudes and it could not be installed properly  if i turned it over the tightening knob hit the dash and in the upright position you couldn't insert it into the cd slot at all  check to see you have some clearance above and below your cd slot because the holder sits close in and cannot be extended outward to clear the dash 
i love colors  and these are so cool  whatever color i am dressed in  i like to match my stylus to   
love it awesome 
this is a knock off of the otterbox case  and it works just as well  for the price  you can't beat it   the buttons work excellent for every function  there are little flaps for the silent mode  charger and the audio jack  which can get annoying but you can always cut them off if you want   it snaps together very well and the rubber  condom  fits well over it  doesn't slide around it or peel off the corners like some others  it is that type of rubber that sticks to your pocket when you try to pull it out  but doesn't collect a lot of lint like some others do 
the philips charge wherever you are with a convenient battery pack   base  as the product description indicates  attachable battery pack provides double the power for my iphone 4g  iphone 3g  ipod 3g and my new ipod 4g effortlessly by placing the battery pack on the included charging base  the unit also charges by connecting a mini usb cable and wall charger  both are included in the package   the system doubles the battery capacity so you can listen to your ipod or use your iphone longer  basically it recharges your iphone ipod on the go  philips also provides a mini usb sync and charge cable for syncing your device  just clip it on when a power source is unavailable  it charges on contact   no plugging and unplugging the ipod or iphone  slip the battery pack into the sleek charging base  plug the wall charger into an outlet using the mini usb cable  provided in the box    the battery pack slides into the ipod or iphone's connector and attaches to the device with suction cups  it does in fact work with most cases  however  i connected it to the otterbox defender   commuter cases for the ipod 3g and new 4g and the iphone 3g and 4g  however the suction cups do not attach because of the material and bulk   i use a small rubber band without incident   i did try using it with the casecrown  belkin gripvue and griffin elan flexfit cases with excellent results   naturally  it is outstanding when attaching the power pack without a case   highly recommend this unique chargeon the go power system 
after trying several different bluetooth devices  i tried this one  and i think we have a keeper  i ordered it for our ceo  and he hasn't complained about it once  so i think it's probably a very good product 
comes in super handy   i can charge both my phone and tablet at the same time  and it works quite fast  2 1a is nice to have    it's not the smallest  but it is quite narrow it fits well between 2 large plugs in my wall mounted surge protector  the only thing i don't like is that the plug blades are a bit difficult to pull out i do have large hands  
a little darker than i was hoping  but it does work  after a while i got a little irritated with it  you might as well just turn down your brightness all the way  you will get the exact same effect except you will be able to turn your brightness back up lol
i do not recommend this product   the materials are very cheap plastic and rubber   in addition  the product did not adhere tightly to the nexus 4 
purchased this item for my daughter  she absolutely loved it  and so did all her friends  saw it in the mall for  25
it doesn't worth it  second screen protector i bought for my gs3  i didn't like the previous one so i buy this cuz of all the good reviews  not sure if they sent me a bad piece happen to produced at the end of their screen protector roll or something pros smooth touching feelsperfect fit that cover over the edges unlike dry apply screen protectorcons slightly reduce screen quality of before and after   i just install a steinheil ultra clear on my wife iphone 5  before and after not a bit of different when i use tips of my nail and ding the screen  it'll leave the ding there  it doesn't seem to heal and flatten out doesn't have any finger prints or oil  most of the time the finger prints or oily from your face make it really difficult to view what's on the screen  i have to wipe the screen clean most of the time i would like a replacement if possible  i'll probably give it another chance if it's product issue  if not  i'll go with steinheil ultra crystal clear  i know i won't be disappointed if i did made that choice before 
i just recieved it yesterday   i haven't really got to use it fully  but it is very slim and the stand works great i am still getting use to it  but it does the job nicely and is very light too 
i had purchased an otter  box   i wasn't impresses with it  i stared looking and found this case  i like the fact it has rubber on the corners for shock protection and the rubber on the back is nice to  i am very happy with this case 
i don't leave home on a long trip without this now   it's essential for long days away from another power source  i'd love to get more than a full charge  like 2   but i think you'd need more capacity   you can certainly get a full iphone 5s charge out of this though  recommended 
just like original   i should have bought 2 to have backup  the included pen i gave to my wife's s3  she loves it 
these are pretty good considering the price  you get 3 different connectors  which is cool  i would recommend this considering the price  i mean there not the most expensively made  but ok  one thing  when i first got it  i had the one connected to phone from wall of house  all of a sudden  my phone blacked out and battery drained  not sure if these caused that to happen  just keep an eye on it if you get these 
i can understand all the commotion of this product because of it coming from china but it came before the 17 days and it fits great with screen protectors i have no complaint
good but the edges are a bit hard  can feel the hard plastic when i put i on my ear otherwise i have no other issue
this is a nice size charger cube that works well with my iphone   i travel a lot  so i appreciate the small size and the retractable plug   i lost my old charger  but like this one so much better   the old one was bigger and could break into two pieces pros  quick charge ducl plug  so i can charge my phone and one other electronic device when i'm on the road small size fits easily into my bag when i'm traveling the   34 plug  34  folds in so you have a nice cube that doesn't catch on things in your bag great pricecons  
these sheet protectors worked well on my daughter's iphone   they fit just right   her and i have no complaints   great service 
these are the best screen protectors i have used  at an excellent price  they go on easily  last forever  and have excellent optical properties  i am currently using the matte version on my iphone 4  it's still a little bit shiny  but does a very good job of reducing glare and minimizing greasy fingerprints  love it 
the product received is as described  great in preventing fingerprints  very satisfied and i would recommend for anyone that has an interest  price is good 
i bought this external battery due to a good price and even better reviews   as long as devices keep sucking more power  we'll have a use for these things issues i have a samsung galaxy sii skyrocket   there's a little charging quirk with these samsung devices which can affect how fast they decide to charge   apparently  this anker astro3e device bumps into this quirk my phone thinks that both plugs are an  ac regular charge  power source  so that means they will rather slowly charge the phone   if you have your phone plugged into the charger and you're actively using it  you can actually draw power faster than it can recharge i'm also sometimes getting faster battery drain after using this pack   according to the following article  this is because pins 2 and 3 are bridged            i'm tempted to build a bridged charging cable or buy an adapter  http   www amazon com gp product b004yx4hdu   just to get around this inconvenience so far  i haven't found an external battery pack that just lets my galaxy s devices charge quickly and without occasional wakelock issues   for other android and idevice users this is probably a fantastic battery pack 
so far i'm impressed with the rear protector i installed on my nexus 4   good fit  easy install  and the protector seems as good as other more expensive protectors i've used in the past   also  it's compatible with the lg bumper case       that's worth a lot to me   good value 
i bought this battery so i could use my phone as an ereader and to watch netflix i can finally last til 10pm without plugging in at 5pm and use the phone the way i want  if i'm careful w usage  i can get 2days out of this battery 
i don't do that much calling and taking calls in cars  but when i expect a call  i wear a wired headset  it just makes it easier  even if i do look like a martian  no earbuds for me  thanks  the jabra cruiser2 looked like it might be a solution  several years ago i had gotten a device that was supposed to transmit tunes from my ipod to my fm radio  and the experience was less than successful  that thing made it to the garage sale the jabra is better  so the technology has come  to me at least  a long way  i followed the simple instructions and it paired with my iphone instantly the sound  though  through the fm radio could be better  i tried several test calls  and it worked   sort of  interestingly the people on the other end of my cell phone calls heard me much better than i heard them  i couldn't seem to finagle the fm receiver to the right station where there wasn't some sound issues i also found it depends where i was traveling  much worse in a city environment  much better out of a crowded area  so if you're in the country  i recommend this highly  if you're in the center of manhattan  i'd probably wait until the technology improves  as it inevitably will 
i love my lg tones    the sound quality is just as good as my skullcandy titaniums  i use them all day on a single charge  i don't know how i lived without them 
bought this because i needed a multi use charger for travel and it does the trick   it was nice in price and quality 
it does not dock easily with my note2 w  a slim case on it  not like the dock media hub which does the job better but pricier   very difficult to use with note 2   my other phone does not even work  samsung galaxy s4   the description did say for all galaxy phones  it would've been a great product like the samsung dock media hub   i think the lip is getting in the way 
i was pleasantly surprised with this case  it's stylish  fits the iphone perfectly  and has room for 3 cards plus some business cards in the pocket underneath the card holders  the magnetic closure worked surprisingly well even with all card slots filled  not too bulky either see my photos   however after about a week of use the edges have started to fray  nothing horrible but i have contacted the seller for a replacement  still a very nice case for  6 
the covers work great for the phone and keep it very protected  i like how easy it was to put on the phone 
if you feel that the gorilla glass needs a protector this is the best one i have tried   it installs very easily because it is semi rigid   i had no issues at all with air bubbles and because it is rigid the corners wont peel   it seems to be crystal clear and i didnt notice any issues with typing or touching   i just dont think this is necessary   the glass of the iphone5 is the strongest thing about it 
love the case   i haven't used it as it is a gift for my grand daughter's birthday   seems to be extra tough and the color is fantastic 
this model  the c500  is one of 4 jabra headsets i have ordered  i continued to try different jabra models because the ear piece is by far the most comfortable and best sound quality i have ever used  however  all 4 jabras had very poor microphone quality  with each one  the persons on the other end could not hear me  disappointed  i found that it worked well with a cell phone  but almost no volume on a cordless phone 
i love this case  its soo cute  yes it stinks  but the smell goes away after a few days  and it is a little loose  but its silicone so i knew it wouldnt fit perfect  it still stays on really good 
this unit is the ultimate case for me  it has the nice soft silicone case for drop protection and the firm  exoskeleton  that protects from damage  it fits nicely and is easy to install and take off  i really like it and my evo 
it works so well at my office that i am asking for another as a christmas gift to have at home  i love that i don't have to take the phone out of the case to fit it in the dock 
no problems at all and so much cheaper than verizon prices hoping that one will be out for motorola maxx hd 
my girlfriend absolutely loved the form factor of her htc one  so finding a case that maintained that was paramount  after looking at numerous cases i finally decided upon this one as a surprise and ordered it in white  the case arrived in a timely fashion  and looked exactly as it was pictured  it fits like a  snug  glove  and would definitely stay on if you were to drop the phone  the case adds almost no thickness  but still feels as if it would protect it very well  the only drawback is that after less than a week of having the case  it has already taken on the color of her blue jean pockets  and is now stained blue in numerous spots  giving it a somewhat dirty appearance  i haven't ran into this problem with earlier cases  and assume it is due to the rubbery like material  overall we are both rather pleased with it  but somewhat disappointed by the staining of the case 
seems to be oem  old battery was just too old  swollen and would not hold a charge  this is working great and is in constant use the past 3 months 
this case is exactly as described   it's simple and thin  slim     it does not cover the top or bottom edges of the phone though   it only covers the sides and the corners on top and bottom 
did not work with all apple
as you would assume from the price  the case is just a cheap piece of plastic  but i just wanted my phone to look good  that was accomplished so i'm a happy camper  wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a protective case though 
i've seen many reviews for this screen cover and people bashing it saying its not a  true  privacy screen  they may be right about it not being a true privacy screen but the truth is i love it and even tho it doesn't totally block you screen it does make it harder for people to read or see what you are doing on your phone  from a side angle it makes everything blur and darker  for the price i have no complaints and would purchase another one  the only thing i dislike is the color  i have a white iphone 4 and this screen makes my phone look like a black iphone 4  besides that i love it and would recommend anyone interested in purchasing a privacy screen at low cost to purchase this one 
don't let the picture fool you  this did not come to my door in this vibrant pretty purple  what i got was a dull cheap looking plastic that wouldn't protect my phone from a hard wind  this is stuck in my drawer  i can't even give it away 
let me start by saying   i wish this was for my phone  unfortunately  they don't make this case for my phone i bought this for my boyfriend's new phone  he is a lot more careful than i am and probably doesn't need a case  but i have discovered a joy of buying things on the internet through amazon  anyways   when it arrived  he opened it up and was trying to figure out how to put it on the phone  it's in 2 separate pieces with no instructions  though it does come with both pieces put together in the way that they are supposed to be placed  however  part of the case is hard plastic  and you can't just slide your phone into that after a little trial and error  we figured it out  slide the silicone part on and then clip the hard plastic part on top  even with that  it took a little bit of fiddling around to get the plastic to cover the silicone  as opposed to just pushing it aside   but once it fit it felt very secure i don't think this case is coming off anytime soon  and i don't know how easy it will be to remove if when that day arrives  i love the stand  which slides out easily and then back into the case quite nicely  i also love the hard and soft protection for a multi faceted approach  as i said  my boyfriend's very careful with his phone but should he ever drop it  this feels like it will protect him nicely 
the bolse 3 port usb car charger is a well conceived tool for powering up several devices at one time   8211  while you drive the charger is stylish  solid  and clearly marked for the kind of charging designed for tablets  phones  cameras  or a variety of other small electronics that draw their charge through usb cords  bolse boasts that their 27 watt 5 4 amp output is the most powerful usb car charger on the market  and i  8217 ve found no evidence to the contrary all ports are listed as   8220 universal  8221  with the following notations  port 1  1 5 amps  is meant for apple devices  port 2  1 5 amps  for android devices  and port 3  2 4 amps  is designed to take on tablets  there are two led lights that inform the user as to whether the charger  8217 s cords are properly connected   cords are not included  but in my experience that is standard  it can fit in the palm of your hand  and therefore can easily be stored in a glove compartment or console i  8217 m extremely impressed with the   8220 look  8221  of the bolse charger  frequently chargers are boxy and square  such is not the case with this charger  8230 it has a very classy white casing  and any 90 degree edges are encased in shiny aluminum  the charger looks terrific the   8220 insides  8221  are well designed too  the circuitry is configured to shut off when charging is done  it cannot overheat  battery power is conserved as for compatible devices  i used the bolse to charge my kindle fire hd  my motorola android  my daughter  8217 s samsung galaxy  and my other daughter  8217 s iphone and ipad  check the advertised specifications on the homepage to see what other gear might also be compatible a 12 month manufacturer warranty is included all in all i have found the bolse to be an attractive  high quality unit that delivers excellent worth for the price  which at the time of publishing this review was just under  13  delivered  with prime membership   i can hardly imagine doing better note  i was supplied this product free of charge with no other conditions other than my writing a fair and honest review    which this is 
this is a great cover case  is very slim  i really like it 
i ordered this after having had a horrible experience with griffin's itrip   i am quite happy with this   it came with two usb cables and one of them fit with lg optimast  if it does not  you can still use your own usb cable    the holder is really nice and you can change the angle almost however you prefer   sound quality is generally good  occasionally  it interferes with other signals but signal is generally strong    the only reason i gave a 4 star rating is because the sound volume is low so i have to turn the volume either on my phone or on the radio up   make sure to adjust the volume when you put your earphone after driving 
i've owned the cheap 3 pack stylus and the targus stylus  but after using this ampen i'm sold on this one  someone complained about having the clip that it was troublesome and got in the way  i don't see how that is a problem  you must have tiny hands to have that problem  flows across the screen of gs3 with a techarmor screen protector without a problem at all  all of the other stylus would work well at first but over short time would drag and stick to screen while trying to using it with swype keyboard or anything else  this hybrid tip works excellent  would recommend to others 
i been looking to get headphones as my old one was abt to get done  i ordered these and they are just perfect  i would say that these same pair might be arnd  15 or more if i get it frm the store  they work just great and are good    
this product does what it sets off to do  it protects your phones shell with a big yet not overly heavy protective shell  the built in hard plastic stand is a godsend but it may require too much effort to open up    however that is way better than having a weak stand that constantly opens up on its own only complaints  it's absurdly hard to remove  generally a pro but i had to replace my phone and was too hard to take off at the store   the phone itself is very big and this adds a few inches  no rugged case will do much better  but you may prefer less protection if you feel the phone is already too big  the rugged design can make it hard to pull the phone off your pocket  but    lets face it  this is not a jeans pocket phone  this thing goes in your coat  cargo pant pockets  purse  if applicable  or you simply carry it on your hand 
my daughter loves this case  it is very cute  so far it is very sturdy and easily goes on the phone   the case arrived early 
i researched external batteries a lot since my evo 4g lte doesn't allow for an extended battery to be inserted  i'm planning an overseas trip in the fall and realized between the phone and my ipod and my wife's ipad i could use extra juice  i've only had the e4 and the anker mini  which i bought to carry in my pocket while i keep the e4 in my backpack  a little over a week and haven't given either a really tough road test  but i'm happy with both  the e4 is a nice device    a tad heavy  but very solid build design  the mini is terrific  i'll write up a separate review for that   i'll need to use both over a month or more before i can give a final  unqualified judgment but for now  they charge easily  i plugged both into my phone's ac adapter instead of trying to charge them through the laptop  and charge up my devices quickly  the great price for the e4 helps make this a killer value my only nit  if i can even call it that  is that the built in flashlight seems both unnecessary and too easily turned on by being knocked around in my backpack  i hope it doesn't accidentally turn on and drain the battery  then again  i'll probably end up using it in an emergency and thinking it's the greatest feature in the world 
despite dealing with delays caused by hurricane sandy the company was quick to respond and resolve   they followed up via email to address mu concerns within moments of the initial inquiry and also followed up to ensure that i was satisfied with the resolution 
if you're looking for booming bass i recommend a sub woofer   beyond that this soundbar delivers very good sound for a low cost   i use it with a 40  34  samsung lcd tv as well as my galaxy s4 via bluetooth   the sound quality is good and the bass is ok for a non sub woofer system   easy to install and set up 
this charger has come in so handy   i've taken it with me to fair when my battery started running while taking pics   i really recommend having one of these   also came in handy when we lost power for a couple of days due to a bad storm 
my daughter picked this case out on her wish list  it is totally adorable  the only downfall of it is that the tail rarely stays on  luckily she loves it without the tail   
anytime you have a mammoth phone like a note  you always have a hard time finding a case that does not turn it into a brick that does not fit anywhere   i feel as though this case has decent balance for the price   protection is not great  but it adds minimal bulk to the phone  so you need to weigh that into your case choices   i am a very small person with small pockets so being able to fit it into some of them is probably better protection that not being able to and dropping it 
first  a little background  for perspective  i'm an ex iphone user  migrated from iphone to android a few years ago  for the freedom and open ness of the os  i've really liked the android os and the phones i've bought along the way  a few months ago i bought a lumia 521 with a new metro pcs account  the lumia 521 introduced me to windows 8 phone os and i was amazed at how fluid  intuitive and fun it is   so i decided to fork out for a premium windows phone     which is what brought me to the lumia 820 the nokia lumia 820 is solid  it's heavy in the hand and has a stable  durable feel to it  the display is vibrant and beautiful  reviewers and  experts  out there on the web can say anything they want about resolution  rag on the pixel density  whatever   but this phone  in your hand is beautiful  colors pop  photos are crisp and videos look great as was the case with my  brief  experience on the lumia 521  this is quick  nimble  fast  every operation is there when called for  tasks present themselves immediately and close just as quickly  there's something about this windows os that must be much less resource intensive  less hungry than other mobile os's  because things just pop and fly all over the place the tiles     live tiles  that represent what feels like a living  breathing os interface  you see the faces of your contacts and friends rotating in and out of the  people  tile     facebook posts of friends  pop up  in live time  as they are happening     news updates circulate in a tile  the tile suddenly flips over to reveal another breaking headline     the tile from your songza app suddenly flips over to say  it is friday night   or late saturday morning  etc       the photos tile rotates through your albums  scrolling slowly and continuously     nothing stands still  this tiled interface is alive more on tiles     you can size and re size your tiles  according to taste  regular  square   large  rectangle that covers width of the screen  or small  one quarter size of regular   you can even pin your favorite websites to the screen  each in a tile of it's own  i've got four favorite playlists  from nokia music  pinned to my screen  each re sized to small  and they form a little music  block   the size of a regular tile the lumia 820 has nfc capability and wireless charging   something i didn't think i'd ever need or use  but i did fork out for the charging plate and it's been a very nice bonus  i've already grown lazy  with the ability to simply place the phone on it's back for a charge     no plugs  cables or hassles customization   unlike other phones in the lumia lineup  this one has interchangeable back plates  once in place  it looks like a solid piece of polycarbonate  you can make this a cyan phone  a bright red phone  yellow  white or black  simply by putting a different  removable  back plate on it  you can order these with or without nfc and wireless charging capability  this phone was black when i bought it  i've since changed it to cyan  and have other colors on order  is the 920 a better phone  how about the 928   well  the specs are better on those phones  but for me  this is the sweet spot  it's smaller than the 920  but with the same screen size  and  again   with the joy of body   color customization  processing speed  system ram  what are those    what do i care  when a phone is as fast  fluid  stable and zippy as this is  who cares   when you get a phone that performs as beautifully as this  you can forget about specs  and forget the  expert  opinions from the tech sites   none of it matters apps     yes  you hear a lot of whining  complaining  hand wringing criticism of the windows app store and it's  horrible dearth of apps   if you believe what you read out there on the internet  you probably figure they've got about 10 or 20 apps in the store  i don't know who these people are  or what they have on their own phones  but inasmuch as the windows store has over a hundred thousand apps  126 000 as of last night      i feel that is enough for me  and for any reasonable person   sure  you can bolster your app store to a million  50 million  a billion  whatever   but when 50 000 of those apps are flashlights  as opposed to one flashlight   how is that improving your app experience the 8gb of internal space     once the os requirements are subtracted  you've got about 5 or 6 gigs to yourself  unlike it's bigger brethren in the lumia family  this one comes with a micro sd slot  i've got a 32gb card in mine  and have set the phone to load all photos  music and videos to the card  rather than to internal storage   that should hold me for awhile the camera     with carl zeiss optics and dual led flash   the 8 7 megapixel camera and quality of your photos will be excellent  i've also loaded an hdr app from the store and have experimented with it  garnering some very nice results  i've been taking photos for instagram  foodspotting  facebook and twitter so far  nothing that requires a critical eye or instrument  i have also set my phone to auto upload all photos and videos to skydrive  so i've got an instant backup of everything i've taken i'm not going to spend any time hashing out or  reviewing  technical details  you'll get plenty of that in other reviews  and websites   suffice it to say  this is one of the best and the most enjoyable phone i've ever owned 
this is a great product  it shows off the phone itself  but keeps it protected as long as you have screen protectors awesome purchase 
this is one of the best cases i have owned for my galaxy  it is rugged and grippy which i love  its also slim enough that it does not bulk up my phone  another great case from fosmon at an awesome price  thanks guys you rock  
i love the way this case looks  colors are very accurate to picture  very hard to get on and off   
the pen works great  i was skeptical at first but had to give it a shot at this price  i am happy to say i was pleasantly surprised and was able to share the spares with my friends  thumbs up guys  keep up the good work on saving us the dough  
warning   the description is very misleading   when your package arrives  it only contains the base unit   there is no power cable  no usb cable  no hdmi cable  no otg cable and no way to charge a second battery while the phone is plugged in   it is only worth about  10 in my opinion 
these protector work  great in protecting your iphone screen  good value for your money  thank you  will order again  thanks
this is a very neat and interesting product  it is not without its share of shortcomings  but overall i think it works pretty well for its intended purpose s   here are some of my quick observations the 4000 mah internal battery is a bit mediocre in terms of its capacity  it will allow you to fully charge your smartphone once  maybe twice  it will not be sufficient for to fully charge a tablet  except maybe some of the smaller ones  i think that this kind of device should boast at least a 6000 mah internal battery to be a really worthwhile feature to have  however  it is still a pretty compact external battery  and if you are in the need of the extra features  voice recording and flashlight   then it could be a really good accessory to carry around for emergency purposes the battery  like many other such devices  features a small led light  it's a neat feature to have in case of an emergency  and i've used such a feature on a numerous occasions  it is not the brightest light you'll come across  but it gets the job done the battery recorder is overall well designed and looks and feels pretty solid  most of these external power banks have a limited number of charge discharge cycles  i am not sure how long this one would last  but i am guessing that it would be on par with other such devices in this category the voice recording feature is something that truly distinguishes this power bank from many of the similar ones  it provides you with a quick  accessible and largely inconspicuous way of recording conversations  you turn on the voice recorder by holding the on off button for three seconds  and similarly you turn it off by the same procedure  the quality of audio recordings that this recorder provides is pretty mediocre  i would not recommend it for music recording  but for voice it gets the job done  all the recordings are stored to the included micro sd card  and they are easily retrieved by transferring them to your computer if you do need a quick and inconspicuous voice recorder  yet don't care about the professional or even good quality sound  then this recorder might be a good choice  especially if you don't envision yourself using a recorder on a very regular basis  for very casual voice recording in a very simple and uncluttered environment i'd recommend that you just use the voice recording option on your smartphone  for more serious recording use you will be better off with a sony or similar recorder      product sample provided for review purposes      
i have big hands  very big hands  but this made a slippery phone even more slippery  like any other bumper  it only really protects the edges  but that won't do much good if you drop the phone because the case is like an eel pass on this and get something that is less likely to make you drop your phone 
only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because it isn't really a protective case like some of my others  but i like the design and color  it doesn't come up and over the sides very much  so if dropped it may not protect the face of the phone    i don't plan on testing that out though   i like to change the colors of my galaxy s3 phone cases  so the colors these come in are perfect for my needs   snaps on and off easily   can't beat the price either 
my grandaughter really like this case it fits the iphone 4s good  it makes a good conversion piece  putting it in your pocket might be a problem 
i like this case because it is blue and it protects the phone and it is durbale and even if you drop it it wount break
the case is beyond what i imagined and is by far  the world's best damn case  i purchased the bolistric case from at t but i should have purchased this one instead  10000  better quality and you get what you pay for
i bought this one after my old one broke  and this one gives off to much static  my old one was pretty clear  i moved this one to multiple places to see if it would work  which it really didn't  the remote is pretty useless besides changing the song and pausing the song  it a super hassle to find the sweet spot to actually get the remote to work  only reason i am giving it two stars is because i can play my music  i ended loosing it so i'm going to buy a new one 
this a solid oem  straight from htc adapter that works fantastic with my htc vogue  verizon touch    very well made  allows for charging and listening to music via 3 5mm simultaneously   works great in the car  and at home 
i love it  get compliments every time i put it on  only problem is that the rhinestones fall off all the time  worth the price though  thanks 
great screen protector but people can still see my screen so i was disappointed that it wasn't as it was described
i should love this battery   the form factor is wonderful  a   charge number  two usb ports  a small led flashlight  and a large capacity   10 400 mah  all great things  overall  it is a good battery i have used more batteries than anybody should ever use  way too many  eachine makes really good batteries  i love their little round flashlight style batteries and their flat pocket able 6000 mah battery  this 10 400 mah batteries kind of fall a little bit short for me  and i'm talking about details here  not major issues the capacity is a little lower than i expected  it will only do about 66  of a full charge on an ipad air  i've charged my ipad several times and only end up getting about 2 3 of a charge  33  to 100   23  to 95   8  to 75    i expect a 10 400 mah battery to give me 100  of a charge on an ipad air  8 800 mah battery   this battery doesn't charge my ipad at a consistent rate  at the start it charges very slowly  at almost trickle rate  after an hour or so  it picks up to the high charge rate  most batteries this size will charge that the super high rate the whole way the display drives me kind of crazy  for some reason i always want to hold this battery upside down and read the   charge display upside down   it confuses me  i've done this now for weeks and can't figure out why i'm always reading it the wrong way  something about the design makes me hold it the wrong way around there are two usb ports  so two devices can be charged at once  you have 2 amps to split between the two ports  this will work great with cell phones  i wouldn't try charging an ipad and an iphone at the same time   it will just take too long sadly it takes a really long time for the battery to charge via the microusb port  a battery this capacity should charge from 0  to 100  overnight   this takes about 4 or 5 hours more than overnight for adding a bit of charge to a tablet  this isn't a bad battery  i wish it charged faster  could deliver a higher rate of charge  and could charge my ipad to 100  from fully dead i was provided a review sample eachine blue 3000mah portable backup external battery lip stick power bank chargereachine black ultra slim 6000mah portable backup external battery three usb ports power bank with inside charger cable
this is a great length but you need to remember that the short cable that come's with your device is optimum for charging  you cannot get the same oomph charge with the longer cables  something about resistance at the longer lengths 
this waterproof case cover every part of the phone and looks pretty too  i really like this and the price point is very good too 
i gave it a awesome rating becasue it works for mei like it becasue i chose it and often get compliments and comments on iti would recommend this product if you are looking for a different looking case that is inexpensive 
hello i bought the screen covers for my cell phone and so far not complaints  very good productthank you
this puppy knows how to sit and stay  oops  i forgot this not a real puppy  lol this is a very nice looking puppy and fits snug into it's spot on my iphone and ipod  the downside is it's bulky and will catch on pockets and purses  the other downside is that it takes a good month before i received this item  this item ships from china and comes through the usps  for those reasons i had to take a point off  enjoy 
when i received the new trent power bank  it wasn't fully charged  but even with 60 80  power it did have the ability to charge  albeit slowly  my ipad   after that brief experiment  i took the time to fully charge the power bank so i could fully charge up my ipad and a few other devices i have   it does have intelligent design and the led display will flash  indicating where it's at   even if you aren't using the device  it's wise to charge it at least once a month to keep things up to snuff obviously with 7000 mah  powering up things like smartphones  kindles  iphones  and things like your gps are a given   take for example  my nook  which was at that critical battery level   in other words  dead as a bag of nails because i never use it   i didn't keep a close watch on it as i charged it with the new trent  but it was fully charged within fifteen minutes   if you do want a battery charger  but don't need quite as much juice  you may wish to consider the popular  sleek new trentitorch 5200 mah external battery charger when i head out to the library or travel  inevitably i never manage to be first on the scene   the plug hogs are always reluctant to give up their territory   like never   if i want to catch a few instructional or music videos on youtube  the battery on my ipad can rapidly deplete   i love this new trent and the 7000 mah has the power to rapidly bring my ipad back up to a percentage i'm comfortable with   unlike the nook which i never use  i'm always using my ipad similarly to my experience with my nook  when i charged my ipad it was a more than satisfactory experience   the ipad battery was down to an 84  capacity and within a half hour i was fully charged   some devices can be prone to using a lot of power and my ipad is one of them   what do i like the most   it has to be the built in cables   they're definitely innovative and tuck in flush to the sides of the power bank   if you need even more power  check out the new trentnew trent enerpak nt120t usb chargeable 12000mah  a heavy duty battery charger   as a first time new trent user  i'm obviously impressed and quite pleased   easy use and high performance i like what's in the box    dual usb power bank  7000 mah    usb cable   32   812 8 mm    user manualspecifications    model name   nt70t   battery type    li ion polymer    capacity  wh    7000mah 3 7v 25 9wh   input   dc 5v  1a max  built in usb cable    output 1   dc 5 0v  2 1a   output 2   dc 5 0v  1a   weight   6 8 ounces  193 grams    dimensions   4 7  x 2 9  x 0 7   119 mm x 74 mm x 18 mm    charge time   8 hoursfeatures iphone 5 battery testingvideo playback  audio on    without easypak   8 hours   with easypak       30 hoursinternet  wi fi    without easypak   7 hours   with easypak       26 hoursthe new ipad  3rd generation  battery lifevideo playback  audio on    without easypak   10 hours   with easypak       14 5 hoursinternet  wi fi    without easypak   10 hours   with easypak       14 5 hoursthis power bank courtesy of new trent with no expectation of a positive review 
this is an awesome product  there is no question about it   if i were in construction or did a lot of outdoorsy work or what have you  this would have worked well   if my husband ever gets a smartphone  i will definitely get him an otterbox case for whatever phone he gets     however  i have a desk job so it was not really necessary   i returned it and i may get the commuter series  still thinking about that a few things i didn't totally like about this were that the sides were too high  i would try to grab my pull down information bar  and i would have to try a few times because my finger didn't quite fit  it was too bulky  and the built in screen was a little too dark  also  not that it matters much  because i have the controls memorized  if you want the lights on your menu  home  back and search buttons to show  this covers that completely and you cannot see them in the dark   not an issue for me because they are always in the same place and i do not have to see them that said  the phone was protected   there was no question that my phone would be fine if i dropped it   but  since i am not really a phone dropper  it was a little too much so  if you are a phone dropper  don't mind bulk and want your phone protected  this is a great product 
this usb car charger is fantastic   it's just what i need to charge my iphone and my kindle fire  or my wife's ipad  at the same time in one plug  this charger has two usb ports  one for lower draw devices like the iphone  only needs 1a  and one for devices that need more power  like the ipad and the kindle fire that both require 2 1a   the maximum output for this charger is 3 1a  which is split between the two ports a couple of nice features    since the 3 1a is split between the two ports  if you plug in two devices that attempt to draw more than that  it simply charges them more slowly   on a long drive that's just fine   it's better than having to charge each device one at a time    there is an inline fuse  3a   so should the charger malfunction and attempt to draw more power than your vehicle's 12v  cigarette  outlet can handle  the replaceable fuse will blow instead of damaging your vehicle's wiring note   to avoid getting stranded with a blown fuse  stop by your local home improvement or automotive store and pick up a pack of 3a 250v fuses  like these set of 5 gma 3a 250v fast blow fuses 5x20mm  f3a  3 amp  i should point out that this charger doesn't include any cables   to charge your devices  use the cables that came with the devices or buy a second set to keep in the car i like this charger   it's attractive and compact   it provides a lot of functionality without taking lots of space   now that our tablets like the ipad and the fire require more power to charge  2 1a   higher capacity chargers like this one are needed i was provided this item for review 
i have tried about 20 different cases ranging from hard plastic cases  soft rubber cases  hard rubber cases  plastic and ruber cases but this is by far my favorite case of all time  its a hard rubber case that grips to your jeans when its resting on on your knee or something but when you put it in your pocket  it slides right out unlike those soft rubber cases  it fits perfectly and its easy to get off it also does what its supposed to almost as well as an otterbox  i have dropped my phone 4ft high onto concrete and my phone is fine  im doubt it cant handle much more than that but that shouldnt be a problem unless youre a window washer or somethingi love this case  i trust this case and this is my favorite case  i use it daily and i will never change there is only one minor flaw and that is that the lock button is hard to push at first but the more you work it  the easier it gets 
works very well for the size of the samsung galaxy note 2   holds phone securely in my jeep  even offroad 
simple product that fixes a common problem  as a family of 3 we all have phones and tablet and sometimes we need to charge more than one device at a time in the car  and this does the trick  small so doesn't take much space  well built  will purchase another for my wife's car 
good and useful cable  working well for me  only one cons  cable a little short   only 2 5 feet   but length not exist in item description 
awesome case fits phone perfect gives durable protection in a fun fashionable way simply beautiful  thick and durable case you can not go wrong
these little heaphones have a great sound now i can put my bigs ones away use my phone hands free while shopping just in time or xmas shopping 
holds a charge  so easy to carry around with the cords in the little carrying case they give you with the product  this fully charged my kindle and then still had some juice to go  highly recommend for anyone who travels a lot  or commutes via public transportation  also  wonderful to have in an emergency situation  will be getting for my family for xmas  
this is a pass or fail product  the band secures phone and stays in place on my arm  i have had plastic screens that were better fit but that is no issue because i can operate the screen
this case is super cute  and really protective  it fits tightly and doesn't make the phone bulky  i definitely recommend this 
the battery is great and lasts a very long time   imax power's customer service is great as well   my battery stopped working and i called them and i sent mine back and they sent me a new one with no problems   i will order from them again   works great for ipod touch   it however does not work with motorola droid  i think it has to do with the electrical power   i think they are working on getting it to work with the droid as we speak   thanks for a great product rktecct
the string is way to short these stupid reviews require us to write all these words when we don't want too   should not be necessary to write more than we wish to say  now we have to write until the submit like comes on   dumb waste of my time 
i purchased this to take when traveling to charge iphone and ipad together so i didn't have to take two chargers  it works perfectly so far 
this case surprise me because was so cheap and looks great  my wife is happy with  the only issue is the plastic that use for get the phone is not more there with normal use  that is the only i dont gie 5 stars 
we have a otter box also and this isn't quite as good   but its not bad for the price   thanks
okay here is the skinny on the iphone chargers with the six foot cords   i have ordered these several different times and the cubes never work the long cord is great but of all of the orders i have placed i have received four charging cubes and not one of them work   so i have to say never again  the cords are great though   do not order charging cubes if you really need a charger because you will be disappointed with the cube it won't work 
i was actually surprised this was as good as it is   for no more than it cost  i wasn't expecting much   other than it not feeling as sticky as my original skin  it started out a little slick but has gotten better as it has been used great replacement 
i bought this when my phone charger died  my ipod charger had nothing to charge from but my laptop  this saved me the hassle for both of those problems  i still use it today 
have been very happy with this dock  as others have said  it has an adapter that you can take out  so it fits with most cases and bumpers  all i have is the poetic bumper  and it works great with that  it even works with my gsm galaxy nexus  so i came back to buy another one for the gnex   
i put this on a black razr m  and it transformed the looks of the phone from nice to beautiful  the fit  and finish are top notch  it may not have been expensive  but it's definitely a quality item i'm very impressed with the raised areas  they're finished perfectly  and make the phone much easier to hold on to  i'm very pleased with the purchase  with the protective case i had on it  it was big and bulky  the cimo turned it back into a sleek phone my girlfriend likes it so much she wants me to get a couple for her iphone  she loved the way it changed the look of the phone  and is glad i got rid of the  otherbox  that was on it 
initially  i thought these were the best screen protectors out there   when first applied  you couldn't even tell there was a screen protector on the phone   however  after several weeks of usage i realized the edges had a tendency to bubble up  i was using it with a case  so that could have contributed to the edge raising up   but even more annoying than that  is that everytime i pulled my phone out of my purse  the screen protector would have all kinds of dents in it   sure they would smooth out eventually  but it just looked bad most of the time   the material is just to flexible and so is subect to impressions from anything that came into contact with it   i'm still looking for the perfect screen protector   
pros the iphone case is as advertised  shock  water resistant and made of durable material   cosmetically a very sturdy looking case  which could also be taking to a business meeting and it would not look out of place or out to a camping trip   construction workers will probably really enjoy this durable case  as it doesn  8217 t add any considerable weight to the phone installing the iphone into the case was relatively easy to do unlike other iphone 5s screen protectors  the home button  is usually not cover or protected due to the fingerprint sensor  however  the trentium does cover the fingerprint sensor   this cover does not inhibit or cause any problems with the fingerprint recognition                                                  cons despite the ease of installing the iphone into case  installing the cosmetic cover to the outside of the case proved to be an issue   in addition  it might make the sides feel a bit bubbly note  wipe the iphone and the case screen before you put it in or you have to redo everything   once the iphone is installed  i noticed air bubbles   i believe this is because my iphone already has a screen protector i have been using the trentium for about a week now and noticed that air bubbles may occasionally interfere with typing or other touch related actions   fix  reinstalling and pushing as much air out does help  however  removing existing screen protector as you the case provides one may be a better solution                                                  overall score  4 75reason  i find the design to nice and presentable in a business setting   i do appreciate the ease of opening the tab cover for both charging port and headphones port   the cameras are not obstructed nor is the image quality hampered   in addition  unlike other screen protectors  the finger print sensor is also covered and protected   an excellently made product                 below is a summary of my review cosmeticslook   4 75reason  the case has a nice smooth look   the plastic tabs that cover up the power port  the headphone jack and the mute rotation lock switch tightly fit to make sure it  8217 s waterproof   the only issue i have with this is that the mute rotation tab cover may eventually wear out from continues use and then become ineffective material  4 5reason  the plastic material and the metal components are sturdy and smooth  yet it retains its sturdiness without making it unpresentable in a business meeting   one issue is that the cosmetic cover will warp the cover causing the side parts to feel a bit bubbly   however  this doesn  8217 t affect the water resistance as the cover fits in the groove tightly installation reviewease  4 75reason  inserting the iphone into the case is easy once you have the case open   based on the way its design  the case snaps into the groove and makes a tight snug fit portabilityweight  5reason  with the trentium the weight addition is not really noticeable   it  8217 s a little bit more bulky then one maybe used to  however compare to other similar cases  this is actually a lot smaller and lighter 
i've had this case for a month now it provides great protection for what it is it is light and has not loosened up great feel  easy to wipe clean satisfied with purchase 
now that i have used this case for about 8 months i can say that it is awesome   provides the right amount of protection without adding bulk to the device   the silicone has not become warped  like happens in the defender series   don't buy those    the plastic outer covering is fantastic and protects against normal drops and dings   i highly recommend 
very  affordable  we  told  ask  of  our  friend s  where  they  came  from   and  the  great  price   worth  the  wait
can't say enough positive things about this item   i have had it in my truck for months and months    use it everytime i get in    have it mounted low on the dash   almost underneath to the left of the radio ac controls right next to steering wheel   the perfect location to plug into my stereo with the headphone jack line out   it fits and adjusts in a variety of configurations    it holds tight once you get the hang of installing it    i have had it for many months and smack it accidently at times and it has only come loose one time and was back on in seconds    i use it for navigation  playing music  even making taking calls handsfree through my radio connection    it looks great  some of the others i have seen out there are gaudy and conspicuous    but this one looks as good as it performs    a grade a   top notch accessory for any large smart phone   i use it with my samsung galaxy s epic    get one  
i loved my samsung galaxy proclaim  but when i got my new s4  it blew my mind  the screen is so amazing that it honestly hurt my eyes a little for the first hour or so  in the same way that a new glasses prescription hurts   your brain is getting so much more visual information than it's used to  so it needs a minute to adjust   as a teacher  one of my favorite features is s beam  s beam allows you to send a file to another samsung phone  just by tapping the two phones back to back  when i need to give each of my students a copy of a handout  i no longer need to print one for each student  i print copies for those without samsungs  but for those students who have samsungs  i just walk around the room and   34 bump  34  the file to each of them in case anyone reading this has read that sometimes when you order a phone online  what arrives is a knockoff  i will say that when i got my phone  i checked all of the tell tale signs for knockoff s4's and the phone i received is definitely authentic 
i looooooooove these buttons    recieved them within 2 days of ordering   they look wonderful on my white iphone and dont leave any sticky residue on the home button   buy this product   
when i saw this case i was like must have  it took about 2 and 1 2 weeks to get here  however  i was still pleased with the product  the only thing is that it doesn't look exactly like the advertised item  the color isn't as bright  and it has a black rim  i still like it thought 
fit well and held everything needed  but color began to peel off almost immediately and strap broke in a month of use 
this battery is so good it outlived the piece of garbage motorola atrix phone it went into   motorola needs to fade away 
you would be much better served to buy a spigen case for your phone  i dropped my phone maybe three times and the black trim broke on the top and bottom parts  i now use spigen sgp10461 slim armor case  i use to think i was very careful but i guess not or i am just on the phone to much  i have dropped my phone about 8 times in the spigen case with no problems  it  8217 s slim and easy to use too 
got this case for my coworker its very cute and stylish havent heard her complain about it so i suppose she's satisfied
imagine my surprise when i plugged an ipad into an android tablet charger  and the ipad     started charging better yet  buy one and experience it for yourself   this thing is a great backup for days when you just can't find your ijobs charging device   or in my case  you have   34 standardized  34  on generic usb chargers and micro usb cabling 
looks great and has held up well  i have it in red and pink too  o  i recommend this cover 
just like most bluetooth head sets the bass is slightly lacking and the fit is slightly loose but for the price you cant beat this product 
seems to last so far   however  given how long my other battery lasted and the seemingly similar problems others have had with their rezound batteries      i'm not holding my breath 
the protector works very well  my only complaint is that the adhesive on the tabs are too strong  you have to use your fingernail to scrape it off  even then   there's residue left on the screen protector 
bought this cable because i lost my mophie charge cable  the item felt like and original and did its job  will recommend this item if you lose your own cable with a micro usb cable 
it works good i can charge my headset and phones on the go i don't have to often charge my phones but i have to charge my headset because i listen to music when i am at work and have to charge it after the fact this charger comes in handy it is small portable lightweight and can fit in your front it back pocket with no problem you might forget it is there it charges headset pretty quickly if dead 20 to 30 minutes but as far as a phone it is a good power source to use your phone when the battery is dead but it charges at a slow rate it will charge a phone if off in about 3 hours and if on maybe longer but you can use your phone dieting this time that the important thing  it wont give you a full charge but you will get about 80 or 90 percent from dead which is better than nothing and it wont give youbut one charge but if you have your wishi had this a long time ago phone on and charging you will get about 8 hours of power nevertheless it will come in handy and i recommended it because when you have no option of charging this gives you a portable option of not having to look for a place to charge your and have something instead of a dead phone i like it take it everywhere i go a must need if you are traveling on a bus or train you wont regret buying it i love it you can charge a tablet or anything with a usb port and van charge 2 devices at the same yime
at less than a dollar per sheet  you can afford to treat them as disposable and not be too upset if they fall off or lose their ability to stay on that long  what sells the screen protectors for me is that they come with a grid on the backing so you can easily measure and quickly cut to match the size of the lcd you're protecting  if you want something more permanent  then go with invisible shield or best skins ever  but for the price and their versatility  they're well worth it 
it seemed very durable but unfortunately it was too small for my note 2  it came up in my search for note 2 accessories and so u assumed it would work  i spent a lot of time though looking on many websites for a bigger one and couldn't find one to fit  if they make a bigger one i'll but it 
pros   works extremely well  great quality  very convenient 2 usb portscons   noneoverall excellent product   great quality   highly recommended 
i love how cheap this item is  but when i looked at  it was not cheaply made and was a solid fix to this day for my phone     
the screen size and resolution are awesome  however moving from iphone to android  especially on this phone is a love hate relationship  the position of the back button  not really a button  on the bottom right corner  has driven me absolutely bonkers  as it is where you would normally hold the phone viewing landscape mode  too many times have i been on a web entry form  only to  inadvertently touch that corner and it's gotten me back  where i don't want to be android vs ios  if you have been an android user all along it will feel great  as an ios user  it's not as polished returned  got an iphone 4s  do miss the big screen  will wait for the iphone 5 and hope the screen is as good 
i really like this car charger dock   the grip fits my lg g2 very well and charges without fail   i'm using the vent clip adapter while i really like the product  i do have an issue with the mount shaking quite a bit while i'm driving   i have a small car with fairly tight suspension  so i feel bumpy roads more than some   however  i think the vent clip portion of the mount could probably use some improvement by giving it a lower clip with which to grab the vent in addition to the upper clip   as it is  if i'm on a bumpy road the phone is shaking so much i can barely make out what's on the screen  let alone actually read anything   my phone fell out once because i had it vertical rather than tilted back a bit   no harm done  but it was a little unnerving    since tilting it back  though  it has held the phone quite solidly the electronics portion of the product works very well   i appreciate that they included a short and a long micro usb cable  and i like the dual color led showing whether the unit is charging or not   other than my one complaint  i feel the product provides a very good value for the price 
great quality  and its so cool that it is textured  fits my iphone 5 perfectly  its a really awesome case
i love this screen protector due to it being matte   i has no glare and the look is great   i wish i had gotten these the first time around  the other brands are ok  but i will always buy these from now on  no matter what type of phone i have in the future   thanks for the super fast delivery and great quality 
pros  good price  high quality film does not degrade retina display quality  good thickness for durability without degrading touchscreen performancenotes  8226  as with all screen films  care and precision is needed during application for best results  8226  be careful with your choice of case as some cases made for the slightly thinner original ipad mini  non retina  may cause the screen film to bubble and lose adhesion with the screen
i already own this one and liked it so much i'm getting another  strong spring clip and that's good  i'm really rough on cases  they last about 6 months and it's thrashed  the magnetic cover works too  most don't stay closed  this one does   
i love how this case is easy to take in and out of my pocket and does not collect lints  i would have given 5  but i noticed that the edge of the case is not perfect  i thought it was a poor job  made it feel kinda cheap  but it fits my need and what i'm looking for  the screen protector is okay  it scratches easily 
it fits well but provides little more than a scratch guard for the back of the device   i with i would have bought something with a little more padding that had a snug fit 
this product came damaged in the box and i don't think it was from shipping  the screen was scratched and the latch was cracked  it looked like a used case sold again as new  i know the product is good when new but this one did not seem to be 
i love this iphone case  makes your phone stand out  good quality  not expensive  i got a lot of likes
i wanted a charger for my car since there are those times  especially with the htc thunderbolt  that you need a charge before you get home   also  when we go on our next vacation  i want to use gps on my phone  so this charger was a necessity   gps is a big drain on your phone   the charger works great  does what it says   i actually like the blue light  unlike what some other people have said 
got for son for xmas  didn't receive til after but my son liked the case  would like to have received item on time 
bought two of these at different times but the magnets in the second one seem to small or placed improperly  where the case closes perfectly and securely over my phone  the second one needs more push n pull to close and keep it closed  other than that i like it 
i bought my first book book this last january  loved the idea that i could ditch the wallet and phone case for an all in one  4 months later it tore at the top right corner on the side that the iphone sits  luckily  12 south warranties this product for 1 year so i contacted them  sent it back and they sent me a replacement the one i have is brown  this black one i bought for my father in law  who decided he wasn't gonna use it so i sent it back   his loss  last time i do anything nice there anyway  i fit quite a bit of crap in it  6 credit cards  1 driver license  my other phony ones i keep in a separate place in my car   some business cards and of course the iphone so my other complaint on this wallet is interesting considering how you would think this case would protect your iphone pretty well  well you're wrong  one day i went to open the door to my local chinese food place using the same hand in which i was carrying the case  wouldn't you know that the case slips outta my hand and falls open faced onto the freaken concrete floor  and yep  shatters my iphone   so  my complaint   or suggestion  i should say   is to make the for grips that hold the iphone in place just a tad deeper than the iphone to avoid such a disaster 
i purchased these for a great price  the verizon store wanted to charge me 14 99 for 3 iphone screen protectors and i bought 6 of them from the seller for about  5 bucks total  this was a great deal 
excellent fit with all the connection cut outs in place    adds very little bulk and still able to see the buty of this phone
generic flex cable  proximity sensor   power button  for apple iphone   oem is ok to repair  your iphone  4 ok
not to bulky or breakable it fix good also with my samsung dock they should make an orange color and a green
update   after several motnhs of use  this unit is working great   range is easily 50 ft   i like to pace while i talk on tough calls  and this unit is flawless for that        the plantronics cs55 is a nice desk based bluetooth unit   i use it on an inter tel phone system at work   the body of the unit connects to your telephone line  an ac adapter  and a unit that sits on your phone to lift up the receiver during calls   so there are a lot of wires  but you can tuck it away at the edge of your desk   the ear piece  which charges on the main unit body  is pretty hefty and i generally have a hard time getting to hang on my ear securely  but it is flexible and after a few moments of adjustment  it stays pretty well but still wobbles around a bit   earpiece quality is very good   for speaking into the unit  you will need to recrd yourself at different mouthpiece placements  e g   talk call in to your own voice mail    the mic picks up lots of noise  rustling of clothes  breathing  drinking  etc    so it is good t be aware of how these are being heard by doing some testing   good voice quality  but watch those extra noises that yo might not be used to thinking about on a normal phone handset   good unit  works fine 
i always buy screen protection for my phone     these are great and easy to install   i bought plenty for a fresh changeover every few months   
these chargers work perfectly  and the price was amazing  i especially appreciate how snuggly they fit in my lighter outlets 
i can't believe for the price you get 6 of these  they work well it's been a couple of months and  i have  only used one of them  you have to take you time putting them on but they really are great  thank you 
this was inexpensive and now i can hook up my phone to any tv with an hdmi connections and it operates in   34 mirror  34  mode  i love it 
great  it did its job and it looked pretty nice  it felt real soft and was as expected  it did start peeling after a little while  it was like a clear plastic that peeled so the color stayed 
love that it is so easy to use and so simple to put on the phone  it comes with a cloth so that is a bonus 
i'm the type of person who usually doesn't write reviews but i had to for this this is an awesome bluetooth for the price   the gel tips and loop makes it very comfortable and fits nice and snug   sometimes i forget i have it in my ear the sound quality is very good  i can hear the caller loud and clear and vice versa  even if i am outside very easy to set up   i have a samsung vibrant and my phone detected the bluetooth right away and paired with no issues at all overall  a great buy for the price 
this solar panel work great for the price under sunny condition never try it on cloudy day yet but i try charging all my accessories that support usb and nothing really fail on me great solar device i love it and would recommend it
my wife is a police officer and i needed a good case for her iphone 4   i purchased this case and that was a good decision   the case is very durable and fits her police belt with ease   she is very happy with this case and it is not an easy task to please her when it comes to a cell phone case for work   this one does the job and does it well   it makes the phone a bit bulky but that is ok as the protection is superior 
this is a really high quality cover for a samsung s5 phone  great design and great quality to boot  will tell all my friends and family about this  product 
this comes with 3 screen protectors   they look like decent quality and went on smoothly   very easy to remove the bubbles with the enclosed tool and polishing cloth   the screen protector has been on for a few days now and looks great  actually  i can't really tell it's there    i would buy another one of these or recommend it to a friend in a heartbeat i've put on quite a few screen protectors so my technique is as follows  clean off the screen with the enclosed polishing cloth   do a test fit  at least a few times so you know exactly where to place   peel off backing of screen protector and start at the bottom and start adhering and use the tool to slide away bubbles to the edges  continue to do this with one hand allowing more screen protector to adhere and the other using the tool to get bubbles out  keep doing this until the screen protector is fully installed   then  go through and remove bubbles not worrying about scratching the top backing film  still be gentle    remove the top backing film  polish with the cloth   don't be afraid to un adhere the screen protector to redo installation to get out trapped bubbles  but sometimes the bubbles can be worked out using the tool 
this is good iphone case for iphone 4 and 4s   when it arrived  my daughter loved it   it has a perfect fit   the surface is smooth and got a velvet soft touch   the zebra pattern is cool too   should have bought a couple more in case this one wears out the only downside is that this seller is shipping it from hong kong and it will take a bit long   and it is not trackable     you kinda have to take it with blind faith that it is on its way   but  it did show up in my regular mail box  and i am more than happy to see it 
very nice product   white and really standout graphic on plugs and looks just like samsung product but much lower cost   transfer files fast and syncs quickly   i love all my ismooth accessories   great company  great products   you will not be disappointed 
this is your average screen   it worked well  but doesn't come with a flattening tool   has the usual frustrations that come with putting screens on 
i have only used this with my nexus 4  i bought it because i figured an lg headset would work best with an lg phone  and it does work well  connects instantly  never drops  but the call quality is lacking  often times my caller is a little garbled  and voice recognition is useless through this headset  at least for me but  for the little i use it  it works well enough for me  if nothing else  it came with a very high quality usb charger 
most worthless phone i've ever had  and i've had some garbage   
this little device is great   i've used it while traveling to charge my ipad  iphone  jambox  and kindle  it charges devices quickly  and the flashlight works well in a pinch at the price  this purchase was a no brainer 
i have dealt with many cell phone accesories in the past as reseller and this product is one of the best  the durability and quality are top notch  absolutely love the packaging as well  would recommend this product to any of my customers 
i have owed every iphone since 3gs   installed a bunch of these this one was hard to figure out which part was the protector and which was the cover   at least for me went on nice and easy for a dry install  with just a few bubbles   i hope they work out   i used my jewelery glasses and have good hands   get help if you don't clean packaging and some extras in case you fumble it up good value for the money  and i have bought several zaggs 
update  this was a four star review when i first left it a month ago  but today  one if the earbuds disintegrated in my ear   not a very pleasant experience  i had to dig stiff out with tweesers  i have never had anything like that happen before  that earns these earphones the lowest possible review  do not buy this product  i wish i hadn't tossed my old ones away my original review is still below   i've been looking for a replacement for my sennheiser earbuds  which deliver great sound but break easily and don't sit comfortably in my ears  the samsung headset has a very unusual design  well  i've never seen it before   it has a double earpiece   a flat  ipod earphone esque speaker with a rubber capped earbud piece jutting out at an angle  at first  i wasn't quite sure how to fit them into my ears  but once i did  i found them to be snug and comfortable and the sound is terrific    bold  crisp and clear  the earpieces also seem to be much better made than my comparable sennheisers  which had a plastic backing that came off and felt  cheap  over all  the headset comes with a microphone  but i haven't used that yet with my iphone  i'll update this review when i do   i've primarily used the headset while listening to music movies on my computer and music while exercising on my ipod  i tossed my seinnheisers and am sticking with these  recommended 
i have both an apple iphone and now a samsung galaxy s4 which is quite a bit larger   i like to be able to clip my phone to my belt   this case holds the galaxy s4 well and seems very well made for the price   i would recommend it 
best battery idea ever  i was a little worried about the soft cover but it's a solid design    i'm thinking about getting another just to have a spare 
this charger accomplishes what it aims to do  charge the phone  and looks pretty sweet doing so due to the blue lit center  however  the charger piece sticks pretty far out of my cigarette lighter port and prevents me from putting drinks in the cup holder  2003 honda civic  with that being said  do not let my 4 stars deter you from purchasing this product if you have ample space between your cigarette lighter and your cup holders
i really like this case and would prefer to give it 5 stars  i want something slim that slips right on and off with a good tactile feel  not too sticky or slick  and excellent access to all controls ports this case meets these standards  although the hole for the power is slightly too small and sometimes you have to jam the micro usb up in there but    6 months after purchase the color has faded and the edges are dirty   not even a good scrub with hot soapy water seems to help  it is inexpensive  but i expect to get longer use out of it  i am trying some other brands before i decide to re order 
this case broke on the first day  the hard plastic will snap if you try to take the case off  i would not buy again 
i love that i have two so  if one goes out i have the other   it works very well in my car   thank yu so much 
these cases do a great job of protecting the iphone  they are robust and apparently well made  however  be aware that they are large and make your iphone nearly twice its original thickness 
got this for a friend and i was surprised at the level of quality for the price and to get three for this price was a no brainier   so far all cables work great 
this case has been great    i've had it for about 4 months now and the color on the edges has worn off  but for  2 to help protect something i use 30 times a day  i will consider this purchase a success   i like to change my covers often  so again  for the price  i have really enjoyed this product 
i've tried these 2 batteries out over the past week or so and they live up to their hype   they have a nice charger that comes with  and their warrantied for 2 years   that's saying something right there   they'll stand behind their product   the batteries themselves are giving me 5  days of talk time do yourself a favor and buy this brand 
seems a  bit harder to keep bubbles out from others that i have used  fits well  overall i am pleased 
i bought this case for my husband because he is rough on his stuff   it is strong and durable   he has already broken the plastic stand on it but it has protected his phone well 
the screen started to disintegrated after a few months of use  bubbles started to form within the screen and i had to replace it  good thing it is a pack of 3  i would go for anti reflective ones if i had to buy again 
the product is okay to sync and charge with computer  however  you can't listen to music or streaming while it is in cradle 
this allows be to plug my note 3 into my computer and use the usb 3 0 transfer rate to transfer files   10 times faster than usb 2 0
i purchased the red sharkk bluetooth speaker  http   amzn com b00gz5e29o  about a week ago and was very impressed with the sound quality and features  so  i started looking at other sharkk speakers and found this one appeared to have some additional features  such as  the eq  ability to see battery life on android phones  longer battery life  and higher frequency response for a great price  i decided to purchase it and compare it with the red sharkk  when i received the speaker  it was dead on arrival because the switch was already in the 'on' position in the box  i had to plug in the usb in order to get it to turn on  then  i connected the bluetooth  bt  to my phone  which was pretty simple  the sound quality with the bass and eq is pretty good  however  when i walked less than a foot away from the speaker with my phone  the connection started to fade in and out  at times  it would completely disconnect  then  when it reconnected  there were a couple of instances where the sound was muffled  i would have to turn the speaker off then back on to get the sound to play clearly  i thought the bt connection and sound issues were happening because the battery was dead  so i waited for it to fully charge and tried again  but the same thing happened  i don't have this issue at all with the red sharkk speaker  another problem is the battery indicator does not appear on my samsung galaxy s3  one thing that i noticed  not sure if its a flaw or a legitimate feature  is i can use the line in connection even when the speaker is turned off  i was testing this on my tv and turned the speaker off to stop the sound  but it continued to play  so  i had to physically plug the cord out of the line in jack  this is a good and bad thing  good because i can save battery life by using the line in without having to turn the speaker on at all  bad because in order to stop the sound  i will have to plug it out all the time  with the red sharkk  it stops when the power is off so i can keep it plugged into my tv without an issue  unfortunately  this speaker did not exceed my expectations or the quality of my other speaker  therefore  i will be returning this and keeping the red sharkk 
hard cover case for kyocera rise c5155 red  this was bought for my daughter for her phone she loves it 
this is the most yolo sd card you can get on the market up to this point in time  yolo
i have a wacom bamboo  a griffin  a just mobile  adonit jotpro  and various and sundry cheapo versions in pursuit of the perfect stylus  let's face it  all the bubble tips appear to be the same  the pogo sketch was my first and the one i go back to for actual drawing and sketching on my ipad  i only wish it was thicker and somewhat heavier  i'd still take the stick over the others for actual work 
yay it works   my daughter loves this case   she has it with her at all times   thanks for making her happy 
i've been bitten many times before buying 3rd party wall and car chargers  usually on the cheap and almost never legit  plenty just don't work right  but i was very happy to find when i bought my motorola droid that there was a real motorola car charger available for cheap on amazon  so i was sold  this  my droid  and thecar dockmake a very happy trio for navigation in my car however  there are a few minor concerns i'd like to point out  first  the blue led  not only does the end of the charger seem to only take up space and shamelessly promote motorola  the blue led creates a bit of a distraction  at least where my cigarette lighter is in my vehicle  i'm thinking of taking it apart and removing the led  but i don't travel at night too much with it so i might let it slide  second  i've noticed that sometimes it doesn't actually charge the phone  just keep it powered   but to be fair  this is probably either my droid or the car  not the fault of the charger itself i haven't had a chance to try charging any other microusb devices with my charger  but i can only assume it works swimmingly  i would definitely recommend this over anything overpriced verizon is offering you for your droid 
i was a little skeptical to purchase this product due to the price was not very costly  the ten piece set for the price i thought was too low  thinking the quality must be low  not  for the price and quality this was a good buy  the length is about the half the size of a regular pencil  so be aware of that if you are looking for something longer 
the red was true to color as you see it in the photo and fits perfectly   the acase has done a fine job protecting the iphone when it has been stored in a high schoolers backpack   the only thing we did differently was to apply a halo screen protector  as we have found these to be the best out there 
i was disappointed in this item   received everything in a timely manner and the price was right   however they don't appear to be very well made and look cheap  such a disappointment 
this is a great product  it is a very good covering case for my bb10  and prevents it from drops and shocks 
the privacy screen is made of a durable material  my first iphone 5's power button stopped working so i got a new one and transferee the privacy film to the new phone with absolutely no problems  and it's holding up well i also have a privacy screen on my macbook pro due to the line of work i am in and it is made by 3m  i find it to much more efficient at what it does  if your display is set to about 40  or higher brightness setting  the privacy screen is pretty useless as when your screen is brighter  when you tilt the phone in any direction you can see the screen  in contrast  if it is set to below 40  its very difficult to impossible to see what is on the screen  i really wish 3m offered a privacy screen for the iphone 5 because i would be more than willing to pay extra for the upgrade but to my knowledge they do not at this time in summary  unless your phone is set at a low brightness setting  the screen protector privacy screen is not efficient at what it is designed to do  this is especially noticeable when you are in the sunlight and need the brightness turned up to see your screen  the film also has a matte finish and is tinted so it takes away from the amazing iphone 5 screen 
this was my daughters absolute favorite case  comes with a cute little stylus and not as bulky as others i have seen  delivery was speedy  thank you
great cover and a tight fit   can be taken off without damaging the phone   the material is a soft plastic   hope you are handy  because some minor modifications with an exacto knife was required on mine  i have 5 covers for my phone  and this is the one i use the most 
the charger that comes with the plantronics voyager legend is kind of useless in the car  since i got the voyager legend to use as a hands free device just in my car  it would follow that charging it in my car would be the most logical choice  the cable on that one is simply too small  this one has a longer cable  but even better  the charger at the end detaches from that cable and can be put on the same cable that you use to charge your phone  this is perfect  i wish they had included this charging option in the original packaging 
i bought this for my father so he could change colors also so he would have extra in case they got lost 
before i even begin this review i just want to say that the new trent powerpak 14000mah portable charger is probably the best one you will ever find and use  if your looking for a portable charger that charges your device fast  is easily portable  and that will last you a lifetime then you should definitely get this one  to me its money well spent from when you first hold this charger you will be amazed at just how durable this thing is  it is built with a hard rubber around the outsides which is great for gripping the device and a really hard plastic on the front and back  i doubt you will drop this but if you do nothing will happen to it because the quality is just that good and as it states it is shock proof which is true as i've tested it out  but wait what happens if you drop it in water  will it break  nope this charger is also waterproof which can last 3 hours underwater as all the ports are tightly sealed charging the device is really simple and charges in about 8 9 hours  it also includes a cable to charge it so no need going out and buying a cable  it does not include a wall adapter but new trent does sell them separately  its really easy to know when the charger is running low on battery as it has 4 blue lights displaying for when the charger is at 25   50   75   and 100  battery life  i must say this battery is amazing and you can charge your iphone from 0  battery to full 100  around 6 to 7 times over well ok let  8217 s say your charging your phone but you also want to charge your tablet at the same time well with this amazing new trent portable charger you can  it has 2 easily accessible usb ports and with this charger having 14 000 mah battery  which means its really powerful  your devices will charge to full charge in a really short amount of time  this is just one the products where you have to see it to believe it  i charged a iphone 5s  iphone 5c  ipod touch 5th generation and a galaxy s3 and they all charged to full 100  battery in about 45 minutes i have forgotten to charge my device so many times at night that i just take this with me and charge it on the go  just take this amazing small charger and a charging cable with you and your good to go  this device is so useful for basically any situation as it could be used at work  in a restaurant  at a baseball game  honestly you can bring this anywhere  i dont leave home without this device its just that useful  it is really portable as it will fit almost anywhere and will even fit in your pocket the packaging is really simple as it includes the charger  a micro usb cable  and a little instruction manual which you don't need as its very easy to use  one thing they could have added is a carrying case as they do with their new trent icarrier  which is a less expensive portable charger if your not willing to spend so much on a portable charger  but as the saying goes you get what you pay for and that definitely applies here  a high powered  waterproof  shockproof  dirt proof and even snow proof portable charger overall i give this a definite 5 stars  there is honestly nothing bad that i can find about this as you should have no problems whatsoever and compared to other chargers on the market this one is by far the best that money can buy  i would definitly recomend this to anyone that needs a portable charger to charge almost any usb device 
beautiful case  i love the fact that it's a 2 piece case  the design is beautiful  i absolutely love it 
love the matte finish  i have had it for around 2 months and its still like new  beats buying it at a retail store 
when it comes to headsets  the sound quality is the bottom line for me  i'm sorry to say that this one doesn't have it  i found the function excellent and especially liked the folding boom mike  i find it easier to use the folding boom to turn it on off when dropping it in a pocket rather than using a button like on most other models  the big issue for me was the muffled sound  both for me and the caller  the other problem is that in a noisy environment holding a conversation became a real problem  i have tested 8 different headsets by pairing two of them at a time  putting one in each ear  and switching between them during a call  this lets me and the caller make a reasonable comparison of sound quality  only one of the other 7 i tested did worse   i also tested the motorola hs850 and found it to have the same pros and cons as this one  
its ok  i thought it had better quality  look and feel but it is pretty regular not as i thought itll be
this is a wonderful battery   it works as advertised and maybe even better for me   customer service was great because i had a few questions about how to use the product and the website had an instant messaging chat feature   i would recommend this battery to anyone that loves staying unplugged for long periods of time but does not mind the extra bulk that it adds to the phone   for me  the bulkiness is really not that bad   i like that i do not have to charge my phone for 3 days on light to normal use and about 1 5 days for normal to moderate use   the battery is really worth it   make sure to read up on how to calibrate and charge the battery to maximize its capacity 
read a lot of reviews when searching for something to keep my galaxy s3 safe at the beach  and decided to try the dandycase   so far so good  though i haven't worked up the nerve to drop it into a sink of water yet  going to test in on an already dead phone though  but it's been around my neck when i was grubby wet from head to toe from gardening all day   phone was clean and dry  yay   even with my galaxy s3 in this pouch  there is still room for id  money  ear buds and maybe a car key  no fob though   which makes it perfect for a day at the beach   i was able to perform all functions with the phone while it was sealed in the pouch  which was really a seller for me   the reason i am giving this 4 5 stars is that there are two design changes i would recommend to the manufacturer   first  the lanyard needs to be a quick release one so you don't have to remove if from around your neck  just release the phone   from reading other reviews  i can definitely see where the sealing clips would eventually wear out   having a quick release lanyard would reduce the number of times the phone is placed in removed from the pouch   the second suggestion for a design improvement would be to place a small clear divider inside the pouch  one slimmer than the other  so that the other  nonphone  contents don't slide around and block the camera lens if you are taking pictures   probably a bit picky on both of those things but i'd be willing to fork over a couple extra bucks if these design features were added 
very slim  looks good and offers pretty decent protection  especially for the price 
what can i say  works flawlessly  i would defintely recommend it  i needed a spare because the charging port on my s3 was acting up  this solved the problem 
i love this case a lot  i have a hard cover on my phone and it fits just fine into this carrying case  i use it for work daily and the only problem i have is that it falls off if i am moving up and down a lot but that is more because of my job than anything  i would definitely buys this case again 
i recently upgraded to an iphone 4s  i looked high and low for a case that would fit into my life  have a little bit of style while not being a case everyone has  searching online led me to this case  it is a slightly rubbery plastic  the pink color  with a hard plastic  clear  case  the case goes on your iphone just like a stiff silicon case  the slightly rubbery area does help with falls and drops   i would not recommend testing this theory just to see what happens   there are openings in the case to allow full function of the camera and flash  see the apple icon on the back as well as access the phone ports and buttons for every port and button except the on off switch  the rubbery plastic is easy to depress over the button allowing easy use of the on off switch  however this case is marketed as pink  on my black iphone it almost looks red or deep burgundy i got creative one day and decided to put a photo between my phone and case  the photo shows through the clear plastic to add yet another level of unique to my iphone over everyone else  8217 s iphones    
it works well and does what it said it would very practicle for me thank youhave a blessed day
i bought this bumper for my samsung s3 and then my moto x  i'll continue buying this bumper in the future  it is durable  soft but not too soft  slim  and simply the perfect cell phone case bumper 
initially i received one spigen case for galaxy s5  it looked very similar to this one  i believed it was the same which i ordered from amazon but shipped from china  i was not at all impressed by the case  but later   in couple days i receieved this case  this case is totally different then the china one  though there are lots of similarities but the finishing and details are very obvious  there were some issues with china version  the flap doesnt open as there was not much room for finger  the back dots were very big and it doesnt look good the camera and flash cuts are too big  speaker cut was  not perfect  overall all cuts were not perfect  the surrounding bumper was also looked cheap  overall please buy genuine spigen case to avoid all these frustrations  genuine one is a clear winner in all details though little thick but you always had case then its not a matter  i never had my phones in cases  so it looks little heavy for me any how i happily recommend this case 
i bought two of these and neither one has enough power to properly charge my phone  i have one that looks identical but is r red and has plenty of power to be useful  these have barely any power 
i wanted so badly to like this charging system but i just can't use it two biggest reasons 1  you can't use your own phone case and the charging sleeve offers little no protection   the face of the phone is fully exposed  the sides are thinner than the width of the phone so if you were to drop it face down  the entire impact would be taken by the screen  the top end of the phone is exposed too  the ease of charging isn't worth the risk for a broken phone from one accidental drop 2  you can't use a docking station  the entire bottom end of the phone is covered   i wish they designed it so that you could still use docking stations   if you don't use them often it might not be a big concern for you but i use docking stations for my ipods every day   this was another deal breaker for me other concerns  the sleeve adds additional bulk to the phone  it makes it longer and just a bit heavier  the base and charging system itself works flawlessly   if this sleeve were designed better  offering more protection and the ability to still dock it without having to use and auxillary port  i would be happy with it  as it is  for the expense of the base and the sleeve  it's just not worth the two seconds of time it will save me   very unfortunate 
works well for my apple products  wish these came with 2 apple ports  but maybe thats coming in the future update  fyi  the apple label port works for all devices including the iphone   ipad and the non apple port will charge your iphone   other devices  but will not charge a ipad 
full disclosure  i was given a free product to review  this did affect my judgment of its performance or my review the bolse high output quad port usb charger works great  at least for me  a number of the other reviews indicate that there appears to be a fairly high rate of failure among these units  so perhaps quality control is not bolse's strong suit  in my experience  however  everything functions perfectly i don't have any samsung products  so i couldn't test the charging capabilities of that port  but i do own an ipad  ipod  and iphone  and the bolse worked just fine with all of them  i'm not sure that it is substantively faster than charging with the standard apple wall charger  but it does give you the option of charging multiple devices from one single outlet when might this be useful  after all  it's not like every outlet in my apartment is full  i'm picturing myself using this when traveling  it's rare to find more than a few free outlets in hotel rooms  and if you're traveling with someone who also has devices to charge  it can be difficult to make sure everyone is covered  provided you've remember the correct cables  the bolse is an economic way to ensure that your batteries are all set to go in the morning the unit feels well built and fairly durable  as some reviewers indicate  the electronics inside may be faulty  but the casing ought to withstand normal wear and tear  a blue led is illuminated when you plug the unit into the wall  this looks pretty cool  although it's really bright when all the lights are off  since i typically charge my phone at night  it's sort of like having a powerful blue nightlight  this is okay for me  but if you prefer total darkness  you may want to put some heavy tape over the led i have no real complaints  the price is fair  the unit is well built  and it works as advertised 
this cover fits perfectly   no guessing the correct size   really protects screen from becoming scratched when carrying phone in pockets  i would recommend for anyone to use 
the htc headphones i ordered were okay  the thing i didnt like is that they arent loud  they are comfortable but not as loud as others are 
some of the buttons on some of the cases are broken   won't push down all the way  others are fine  i love all the colors and for the price it's a good buy  they all fit well  just wish all the buttons worked and the few weren't stuck 
i purchased this battery for my mom  she has had her envy 3 for almost 2 years and the battery wouldn't hold a charge  the price on this was great it works like a charm  she is very happy with her phone again 
a cable is a cable  they work about 99 99  of the time  amazon is always the way to go  because they're always the cheapest  i love being able to just plug this right into my phone and display on the tv without any hassle  options pop up right away  or you can set the options manually 
love the black gloss finish  protected my phone from a few drops already  a little hard to get on and off but no biggie 
lol  i love this cover  it lookes like an old boom box  great gift and an eye catching cover  great conversation pieace  worth having
i bought this headset to work with my audiovox smt5600  not listed by jabra as compatible  but i took the chance anyway  the headset  which i purchased online  arrived with no instructions  but did include the charger  charger cord  belt hook  and several earbuds  a quick search online discovered the manual and pairing was accomplished shortly thereafter  all functions of the headset  including vibrating ring and voice dial  work with my phone  sound quality is generally excellent    it's at least as good as the phone's earpiece  all bets are off if you're out in the wind or driving with the window down  precisely the same conditions under which you can't hear the phone's own earpiece either  external noise such as a crowded restaurant doesn't seem to be a problem for my combination of phone and headset  the short boom mike seems to be acceptable    nobody has complained they can't hear me  in fact  i can talk pretty softly under most circumstances and be heard just fine  external noise such as a crowded restaurant doesn't seem to be a problem for my combination of phone and headset  the battery is advertised to last a long time and it does  i haven't measured any run down times  but the headset needs to be charged less often than the phone  which with bluetooth on needs a charge every couple days  the headset is light and  for me  comfortable  after wearing it 12 hours a day for the first several days i forget it is there  the headset is reversable by the simple expedient of rotating the earbud  the dorsal sping of the headset contains one button and one rocker switch  because of the location of the switches they do not need reversing  the rocker controls volume up and down  the button combines on off and answer hang up  press the button to answer or hangup  hold for about 5 seconds to turn off on  my phone hangs up when the other party disconnects and conveniently  so does the headset  the headset slips into the charging cradle like a knife into a holster  an accessory clip attaches to the charging cradle so you can hang the cradle  unplugged  of course  on your belt or waistband to carry the headset when it's not being worn  with practice  the headset can be put on with one hand  there is no provision for charging in an automobile  which would be inconvenient were battery not so long lasting  just pop the headset into the charger in the evening and you're good for the next day  on an extended trip the charging cord and cradle must accompany the traveler   other than the lack of a car adapter  which can be remedied aftermarket  my only complaint is that the headset is somewhat wobbly on my ear and the ear bud occasionally works itself away from my ear canal  this is not always immediately apparent until a call is made received  this is aggravaated by the fact that there is no way to adjust the headset  it being constructed of a plastic shell with a soft lining against the ear  even the flexible shaft holding the ear bud does not adjust side to side   the headset is rated for up to 30 meters  this does not include walls or other obstructions  jabra recommends you wear the headset on the same side that you carry your phone  practice proves this  lack of adjustability aside  this is a good headset with outstanding battery life  it's available at a reasonable price and  thus far  no other headset has wooed me away 
this is a great case  i'm not gonna li  i pre orded the case and got it about 1 or 3 weeks after the phone had come out  the case is amazing  buttons work good doesn't make the phone too bulky and it makes it looks more expensive than the  30 it actually costs  i payed  15 btw   the only thing i have a problem with is the fact that my car charger wont work with this case  the original samsung usb cable works perfectly but the samsung car changer i got off amazon wont connect to it at all unless i take off the case which defeats the purpose  it gets annoying having to take off to charge then put back on after wards  its not hard to take off and put on just gets annoying   other than the minor little thing i have no other issues with it  my earphones connect my original samsung cable connects  its a great case that needs a few more adjustments here and there 
i received the case and started using it for some time only to realize that whenever i made a phone call the person on the other end couldnt hear me  i then realized its because its a fake  dont waste your money 
from the moment you first see this phone you know it's special   it looks huge  expensive  and powerful   by contrast  the droid x looks huge and powerful  but not expensive this is an android phone running android 2 2  2010  with htc's sense on top   despite sense it is lightning fast  intuitive  and easy to get the hang of   once you're acclimated  it's very powerful and flexible   sense delays software updates  but it might be worth it to you  personal preference  of course  call quality is great  signal strength is great  and the phone is a great performer   4g isn't in my area and you'll be taxed a  10 month  smartphone tax  by sprint  but aside from those two issues this is an amazing experience i had no issues with the device's software  and only one tiny issue with the hardware   the lip of the phone that rests against your ear while in use is a little rough on my ear  leading to discomfort on long calls   that's it though  otherwise this is a 10 out of 10 
i was very happy with this purchase   an oem usm charger for a fraction of what sprint wanted for one   a great deal 
this usb charger has two dedicated 2amp ports and two 1amp shared ports i used to use two 2amp chargers to charge samsung note 2 and samsung note 8 0  but now one charger can handle both and they can get fully charged from less than half battery in 3 4 hours  or much shorter when both devices are in standby  all you need is a ac cable  included  and few usb cables  note  in order to get the best result  the cable should not be longer than 2 meters   in addition  it does not generate much heat  it gets a bit warm when two 2amp ports are used  so it looks like it can handle such high power this is highly recommended if you have two tablets  or if you have a tablet and a large screen smartphone  a must for iphone 5 or galaxy s3  s4  note  note 2  
these styluses  styli   are about as good as any other capacitive tipped ones that i have used   they have a nice cord that plugs into the devices headphone jack to secure them  but the cord is so short that you have to remove the plug to use the stylus putting wear on the port and the plug   they are also quite short and i am rather large so i found them awkward to write with as they are much shorter than any pen or pencil that i use 
i must say i was not expecting that much from this case considering the price  i got it today and put it on my bad boy of a phone and was quite amazed of how good it felt in the hand and it is very light  no bulk can be felt by the case and come on the kick stand works well too  however  i will say that it will take some time getting use to that little hump in the back for the kickstand but seriously its really not that bad  this is my first kickstand case and this review might be partial but i really like it     i recommend the case 
this worked well  i bought two of them  i kept one and gave one away  i'm still using mine and it still works fine  it was worth the money 
it is a nice screen protector   very hard to get all bubbles out after installation   other than that it was easy to install and fit perfect  
it seems to do the job that it was specifically designed to do when the instructions are followed even though they are not difficult 
love this  from the colors to the protection it was a great buy n still fits in my pocket or purse nicely   unlike other big bulky cases  
this wallet is okay for the price  it doesn't really stay closed because the magnet strip that it uses to close will open easily  so you must be careful if you put any credit cards into the slots  my phone hasn't fallen out of the slots in the wallet so far  so i say it's okay to store your phone in it  but it's serving the purpose of having something to store my galaxy note 2 in it so it's okay 
the screen protector does what it does and lasts for quite a while   i change it once about every 4 6 months 
on long days with lots of movement and no time to plug the phone in to a wall  this is great at keeping the thing charged  it's slim enough to fit in a pocket next to the 'phone  so the 'phone is charged up and ready to go when you need it  i can charge my 'phone or tablet several times on one charge of this charger  fantastic  i rarely leave the house without it 
have been using this product for over a month  fits perfectly on my arm and very well suited for my samsung galaxy phone  love it 
if you want a case that protects the phone from drops and bumps  look elsewhere  this case is thin and barely covers the edges  it does not cover the corners at all but it does fit well  and provides a nice grip  it's nice and thin so doesn't add much to the thickness of the phone  if this is what you want  a good fitting thin case with a great texture  but no protection   this would be a good choice 
i received this charger in the mail within one week of ordering it  it works great for charging smart phones  and not just motorola phones either  i own the htc one and it charges my phone from 0  to 100  in a matter of 50 minutes 
for the price i love it  great quality  but over a little time the corners start to fade a little and the pockets get a little loose  i'm about to order  second one  but it's affordable enough i can change out the look  definitely satisfied and recommend to friends 
slim  but protects the phone    good overall   get one for yourself  i've owned 5 and they are my favorite   keep a spare 
make sure when buying this product you do have a samsung galaxy note2 because it is not compatable with any other phone 1  the instructions are not very informative2  in some instance it claims to be universal and it clearly is not  i tried 3 different phones 3 it does state that all mice or keyboards are not compatible the price is  99 00 then you would have to buy a mouse and keyboard that is compatible you might as well buy a laptop 
it has been a while since i purchased this device and it still holds up  it functions just like a regular galaxy  duh i know  but i would say if you do not like iphone's nor the big samsung screen then definitely use this as a phone it's like the two phones in one 
this case is really nice and high quality  thicker and a little more slippery than i hoped  but it works really well  im not afraid my phone will get damaged with this on 
i'm well pleased with these screen protectors  they fit perfect and are very durable if you use screen protectors you'll like these 
it's good  reasonable price  fits well  whypay more  you wind up replacing them ever so often anyway  enforcityputs out some decent stuff at a great price  
i really like this case  makes my note 3 look sleeker  not sure how it would hold up to a drop but rather not find out    only wish they sold the frame separately like they do for the gs4
i had this parrot professionaly installed on my pioneer avh p4100dvd  it works great for making and receiving calls  windows down or up  people hear me great on the other side  noone has complained about hearing noises on the background it pulls not only my contact list from my iphone but also the battery charge level on the little screen   voice commands work amazingly good the only complaint i have is that if you turn on the unit  when you turn on your car  with the iphone already connected to the radio  when the iphone starts to play music  the parrot will detect it and will swap the music to bluetooth  that means that it will mute the radio  freeze the iphone music controls on it and transfer both audio and iphone controls to the parrot unit     i hate that   the only way i get around this is to connect the iphone to my radio interface after the parrot has turned on completely and detected and sincronized the iphone but  again  the bluetooth connectivity for making and receiving calls  works like a charm 
i don't like the magnet on the product  the description did not say that it had a magnet or at least i didn't see that in the description  it still serves its purpose  but i find that he magnet comes off easily  so i'll buy one that has a snap closure 
i would give this five stars  good price and good protection  it's got a fun tire tread pattern  doesn't show dirt or wear  i would recommend this case 
this headset has held up pretty well  i don't use it on a regular basis  but it is currently in my laptop bag 
came on time  and the kickstand is awesome   it makes your phone even bigger but it makes it more sturdy  in my opinion 
it locks and it is great
it locks and it is awesome
it locks and it has locks
